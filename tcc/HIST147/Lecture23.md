# Appomattox and the End of the War
    * CSA Army, Lee and the War
        > Confederate army was melting away, soldiers were deserting 
            Result of military defeats like Pittsburg and two law passed that underminded support for the confederacy
            1. Confiscation Law
                > South was poor, it's wealth was in land and slaves not money
                    How to pay for war, one way is with the confiscation, allowing the confereacy to confiscate a percentage of your animals, cloth, etc
                    If your a struggling planter Yolemans, it can devistating
                    Some confiscation officers were corrupt, take more than allowed and sold on the black market
            2. The 20 Negro Law
                > For every 20 black slaves, one white man was inelligible for the military and could stay home
                    Yoleman did not own any slaves, so they got no protection from this, and they see it as they will have to fight the war
            These two laws + military defeats desertion skyrockets
            Now there are armed deserters in Jones County, so army was dissolving and Lee knew this and knew the war was lost
            Fought on because Davis dillusionaly thought they could win
    * Grant Attacks and Purses Lee
        > End came in Apiril when Grant launched a massive attack on Lee's line in Petersburgh
            Lee ordered a evacuation of Petersburgh and Richmond, Lee fled westward, goal was to turn south and meet with confederate forces
            Grants army got ahold of Lee's army in Appomattox Court House
    * Appomattox Court House
        > Grant offered lenient terms, the confederate soldiers have to put down their arms and pledge not to take up arms against the US ever again
            Grant also agreed to provide rations for Lees starving troops and allow men with horses or mules to maintain possession of them
            They could return home in peace
            They accepted the terms
    * Lincoln at Ford's Theater
        > When Lincoln received word of the surrender he gave a speech, Lincoln focused on what comes next
            He endorsed some black men the right to vote
            John Wilkes Booth, said that was nigger citizenship
            Booth had plans to kidnap Lincoln half way through the war, but when the CFA collapsed Booth wanted to assassinate Lincoln
            Booth himself would try to shoot the president, second man would kill the vice president, and the third will kill the secretary of state
            On april 14th the plan was put into motion, Lincoln and his wife went to Ford's theatre to see a play, he had a single body guard
            Half way through the play the body guard left to watch the theatre
            Booth shot Lincoln in the back of the head, he was later chased down by union calvery and killed
            Secretary of state and vice president did not die
            The conspirators would be rounded up and executed
            Lincoln's death brought a massive outrage and turned him into a martyr
## Results
    * Over 700,000 dead
        > Military and civillian
    * Slavery was eliminated
    * The doctorine of secession was destroyed
    * It created a better-integrated society and more technically advanced and productive economic system
    * Ensured that ultimate power rested with the Federal government

## Reconstruction
    * The attempt to deal with the afereffects of the Civil War
        * Four parts
            1. How to readmit the now conquered states back into the union
                > Under what terms
            2. Who will rule the south now
            3. Rebuilding the ruined southern economy
            4. What to do with the former slaves

## The Republican debate
    * Lincoln's plan
        > Lenient, for state to readmit, 10% of its 1860 voters had to take a loyalty oath, state had to accept all laws and proclamations regarding slavery, Lincoln excluded some groups from political conversation, former confederate officials, federal officials who resigned and joined confederacy, anyone accused of mistreating black soldiers
    * The Radical Republicans
        > Lincoln's chief opponent, a small but influential group of congressmen and senators, before the war they were abolitionists and part of the anti-slavery movement
            Wanted to give equal political and civil rights to blacks, stripping the planters of their power, transform the south into the economy the north had
            They put forth their own plans, called for 50% of 1860 voters to take a hard loyalty oath, also excluded many groups from political participation
    * Thirteenth Ammendment 
        > When the war came to an end nothing had been resolved, but there was one thing all the republicans agreed on
            The Amancipation Proclamation was not enough to end slavery, more importantly everyone feared after the war someone was going to sue someone to get their slaves back
            The solution was a constitutional ammendment to forever ban slavery
            Congress would approve the ammendment and send it to the states
            Lincolns death made Andrew Johnson, the vice president, president

## Andrew Johnson
    * Background
        > Came from the Yoleman, Democrat
            Only southern senator in a seceded state that did not support the confederacy
            His loyalty was rewarded with becoming vice president
    * Johson and the Republicans
        > Johnson was a Jacksonian democrat, disagreed with the Republicans on every issue
            Opposed Republican policy, government support of economic development
            He was hostile of the Republican vision of the black men place of society
            He supported amancipation as a way to punish the planters, now the war was over he was commited to white supremacy
            Had no desire to give equality to blacks
            When the war ended Johnson is in complete control of reconstruction
    * His plan
        > Lenient, desire to get Southern states back into the union as quickly and painlessly as possible
            1. Offered amnesty and property coverage to anyone that would take allegiance
            2. Excluded some groups from taking the oath
                > Same as Lincoln but also any person with taxable property more than $20,000 
                    The planter class, offered the chance of applying for a presidential pardon
            3. The eleven seceded states were to right a new state constitution, only white men who had taken the oath of allegiance could participate
                > They were to abolish slavery, nullify secession, repudiate all confederate debts
                    They would be readmitted into the union with the same rights as the other states
            Southern states quickly did as Johnson asked of them
    * Pardons
        > To the shock of many northerners, Johnson issued pardons by the hundreds everyday
            He granted the majority of applications, including ex confederates who could gain power in their state again, this was too much to the republicans
## Southern Reaction
    * Johson's plan and the South
        > Many southern states weren't even going through what they were supposed to under Johnsons plan
            Mississipi and South Carolina refused to repudiate their Southern Debt
            Mississipi and Texas refused to ratify the 13th ammendment
            White former confederates thought they could be let back into the union without punishment
    * Black Codes
        > New legislators were passing black codes, laws regulating status of the free people
            Some were allowing people to get married, own property
            Excluded blacks from juries, segregation
            Provided more severe punishments to blacks for the same crime
            Allowed law officials to arrest black vagrents, which was defined loosely
            Some defined white employers as masters
            Northerners interpreted these codes as an attempt to overturn the end of slavery
    * Southern Elections
        > Last thing Northerners got angry about
            Voters turned to ex confederates in huge numbers
            It appeared the confederates unable to capture Washington during the war, were about to do so in peace

## Congressional Response
    * the opinion of Republicans and most northerners
        > Asked who won the war, it seemed under Johnson's plan there had been no war, the defeat of south could resume it's place in the union like nothing had changed
            It convinced the republicans of congress that the presidential reconstruction had failed
            Republicans sought to reserve the results of the war, guarantee freedom of blacks and some civil rights
            Protect unionists in the south, black and white
            And ensure the ex confederates did not resume running the south
            Did not want to antagonise Johnson, but determined to undue much of his reconstruction program
            To began with, the republicans refused to admit the newly elected representatives in the south
            They proceded with the Freedmen's Bureau

## Congressional Reconstruction
    * Freedmen's Bureau
        > Designed to aid the newly freed slaves, by providing them with food clothing and other necessities
            Goods were also given to destitute whites
            Sought to secure fair labor contracts for blacks
            There was no controversy in this bill, passing congress easily, and to the shock of everyone Johson vetod it
            Called it unconstitutional
            Since such relief had been given to whites, it should not be offered to blacks
            Republicans would override Johnson's veto and pass it back into law
    * Civil Rights Act of 1866 
        > What rights to give to the freed people? 
            The Republicans led by moderates, decided to give them the basic rights of citizenship, civil not political
            Declared anyone born in the US, other than an Indian was a citizen with federally protected rights
            Including the right to a jury trial, to sue and be sued, right to serve on juries
            For the first time congress defined the rights of American citizenship
            Fearing the break of congress everyone asked Johnson to sign the bill but he vetod it, denouncing it giving special treatment to blacks at the expense of whites
            The Republicans overrode the veto and it became law
            The Repubicans were not unified against the president,
