## Sources of Labor: Immigration
    * Massive wave of immigrants from europe majority going to the U.S.
    * Three Reasons Why
        1. Better economic oppurtunities
            > U.S. was wealthy
        2. Reputation for hospitality of victims of political oppression 
        3. Propoganda
            > Companies kept recruiting agents in Europe and distributed pamphlets that described America in way
                that were not always true
    * For most immigrants who came they struggled to survive
    * Second Wave of immigrants came from Southern and Eastern Europe
        > Russians, Czechs, Romanians, Greeks, Italians, Jews
    * Implications for American society
        > Second wave immigrants had different cultures and religions
    * Not every immigrant stayed            
        > Most were people seeking temporarily employment
            wanted to get enough money to buy a business in their own country
    * Immigrant Neighborhoods
        > Immigrants who stayed gravitated to other immigrates
            these places served as transititional communities
            they could speak their language, practice native customs
            Group that immigrated to the US did not assimilate with the American culture
    * Second Wave sparked a nativist backlash against it
        > People were afraid of alien religions, foods, and languages
            nativism was not strong enough to stop the immigration except for the Chinese
            Chinese immigrants were arriving in California with the gold rush
            They provided much of the labor for railraod construction on the west coast
            Putting them into competition with white working men
            Who disliked competting with the chinese because they worked for less wages
            most were single so they did not have to support a family
            Opposition of chinese was racist, they were characterized as an inferior type of human being
            White mobs would raid China town, this led congress to pass the Chinese Exclusion Act
    * Chinese Exclusion Act
        > Ended all chinese immigration to the US
            This exclusion would imposed on all asians later on
    * No immigrants settled in the South because there were no economic oppurtunities 

## Unions
    * Workers tried to organize together against big business
        > individual has no power, but if all workers organize has the power to negotiate with management
            this was the only way they could improve their conditions
    * Major obstacles to unionization
        1. Companies could always hire poor immigrants to work for lower wages
        2. Cultural, racial differences among workers
            > Whites did not want to work with blacks
        3. Prosperous skill workers, felt little in common with low paid laborers
            > Would not work with them
        4. Workers in different industries saw little reason to cooperate with one another
    * It was not until after the civil war the first National Union was est
    * National Labor Union
        > Founded immediately after the end of war, sought to bring workers together from different industries
            Sought 8 hour day, equal rights for blacks and women
            Unions focus on a political solution meant it spent most of its time lobbying in WA
            Costed its popular support, and the group vanished after the depression of 1870s

## Railroad Strike of 1877
    * A pivotal turning point in the history of Unions
        > When the depression began companies cut wages, then in 1877 the Baltimore Ohio Railroad cut wages
            It was too much for it's workers so they went on strike
            supported by locals 
    * State governments tried to crush the strike
        > This led to riotiing and battles
    * Strike was finally crushed when the President brought in the US army
    * Result
        > property damage, many were killed, strike failed
            but it was a pivotal turning point because it demostrated the potential strength of organized labor
            and the need for greater organization

## Noble and Holy Order of the Knights of Labor
    * Out of the depression would form another union
    * Terence Powderly
        > leader, son of Irish immigrants
            organized a series of victories in labor battles
    * What they believed
        > they did not object to the rich getting rich
            they hated that monopolies had narrowed the right to succeed to a privileged few
            robbing everyone else of the chance to succeed
            they believed the free-labor ideology had failed
            battle was about dignity and independence
            they wanted more than just improvements for workers, they wanted to reform the entire industrial system
    * Platform
        1. Who did they accept into union
            > All wage workers regardless of sex race or color
                no bankers, lawyers, stock brokers, gamblers
        2. Equal pay for women
        3. End to child and convict labor
        4. Wanted a progressive income tax
        5. Government to print paper money 
        6. 8 hour work day
        7. Wanted immigration restrictons
        8. Wanted cooperative employer employee ownership of factories

## Decline of the Knights of Labor
    * Won a clash with the Wabash Railroad
        > Knight membership grew massively 
    * Knights became the largest union
    * Became assosciated anarchism
        > Haymarket Square riot did this
            Massive strikes occurred in support of a 8 hour work day, one of them was in Haymarket Square
            During the demostration someone threw a bomb at the police, killing 7 officers
            Police fired into the crowd, 8 anarachists were arrested and tried
            Rigged trial they were going to be found guilty no matter what
            One of these men was a member of the Knights of Labor
            Media linked Knights with anarchism in the public mind
            Members began to leave as they did not want to assosciated of anarachism
    * Anarachism
        > Believed that any government was a abusive device used by the powerful to oppress the working class
            Transistion to a government less society could be done by promoting violent revolutions
            Ideology feared by upper class
    * Results
        > initiated industrial unionism
            industry wide union of the skilled and unskilled

## American Federation of Labor
    * Another reason for the knights decline was another union that hated the knights
    * Grew out of the Cigarmakers International Union
        > Led by Samuel Gompers
            Cigarmakers were considered the intellectuals of the laborers 
            they hired young men to read to them while they worked
            Cigarmakers were a skilled union and other skilled unions opposed the knights
            They did not like how the knights were trying to poach their workers and join the knights
            The skilled unions formed the AFL 
    * Business Unionism
        > Advocated by the AFL
            1. Accepted industrial capitalism
            2. Rejected partisan and utopian ideas
                > Sought purely economic action
            3. Concentrated pratical goals
                > Raising wages, 8 hour work day, employer liability
    * Who was allowed to join
        > Only skilled workers and white men
            wanted nothing to do with blacks or immigrants or women
    * Became the largest union in the US by 1920

## Strikes
    * Industrial labor movement would be set back by a series of deadly strikes
    *
