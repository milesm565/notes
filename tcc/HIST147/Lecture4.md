## Transportation Revolution: Steamboat  
   * Problem: rivers only went one way  
   * Solution: Steamboat  
      > Used the Steam Engine, devloped by Great Britian, to propel a Boat  
   * First successful steamboat built by Robert Fulton  
   * In 1807 successfully propelled the boat up the Hudson River  
      > Made possible two way traffic on rivers  
   * By 1820 69 steamboats were plying western waters, by 1830 there were over 200  
   * Great boom for both farmers and merchants  
      > Reduced costs, increased speed of moving goods and people  
         Allowed two way commerce on the Mississipi and Ohio  
   * Manufactureres and merchants had a better way to reach inland markets  
   * More than just a transportation, captured the American imagination  
   * Steamboats often raced against eachother  
   * Dangerous, and had a bad safety record  
   * Difficult to gauge pressure of steam you were generating  
   * Often blew up, ran aground, and frequently collided  
   * Federal government began to regulate steamboats, monitoring construction and operation  
   * Only great commerce if you live close to river  
   * If you can't come to the river, you can get the river come to you with the Canal  
   * Canal artificial water way built by humans  
## Transportation Revolution: Canal  
   * The Erie Canal  
    >  Goal to link Hudson river with Lake Erie  
      Called the Big Ditch  
      Greatest engineering achievement of the early republic  
      Immediate economic success  
      Reduced the cost to 1/12 previous  
      Linked the economies of the NE and the mid west  
      Helped make NY city the commericial capital of the nation  
   * Other states were jealous, 1830 sees a great Canal building boom in the North  
      > Most other canals were financial failures  
         States had to go into debt to finance them  
         They did not return cost, because Railroads would replace canals   
## Transportation Revolution: Railroad  
   * Railroads could be built wherever canals were  
   * Cheaper more economically efficent and wouldn't freeze in the winter  
   * Last stage in the Transportation Revolution  
   * Railroads were the dominant business after the Civil War  
   * Railroad makes use of the steam engine  
   * First built in England in 1814  
   * First prototype locomotive was built in 1825 in America  
   * Key development was designed Keeter Cooper who made a locomotive perfectly suited for America terrain  
   * Tom Thaum  
   * He raced a horse wagon, the horse won  
   * The Rail boom began in the 1840s  
   * Another 4000 miles of track would be laid  
   * They would lay more than the rest of the world combined  
   * The railroad helped facilliate the rise of Chicago  
   * Further tide the Nw and the mid east together economically, politcally  
   * Helped to speed up the Industrial revolution  
   * Created lots of industries, rail manufactoring, locomotives, and rolling stock  
   * Created lots of jobs, encouraged workforce to leave agriculture, as engineer, firemen, break men, switch men, conductors  
   * Railroads became the first big businesses, large corporations under private control  
   * Created a new profession, business management  
   * New management techniques introduced by train engineers  
   * Recognized the railroads required systematic management  
   * Managers setup the rules for how railroads regulated  
      > Based on army regulations  
         Established lines of authority  
         Determined train scheldules  
         Spelled out employee practices at all levels  
         Would be adopted by all other big business after civil war  
   * South has not developed a railway system linking it together unlike the North  
  
# Effects of Transportation Revolution  
   * Faster travel  
   * More efficent and cheaper travel  
   * Facillitates the Market Revolution, getting more people to produce for markets  
   * The railroad is also part of the communications revolutions  
   * It also sped up news and mail being carried  
  
## The Communications Revolution  
   * The invention of the telegraph  
      > Uses wires to transfer electrical signals over great distances  
         Provided for the first time instantaneous communication  
   * Samuel F. B. Morse, invented first telegraph  
      > Not a scientist, engineer, or mathemetician  
         Built apon electomagnetic signals  
         Received funding from congress in 1843 to build the first telegraph line linking washington D.C. with Baltimore  
         He then demonstrated his invention to Congress  
   * Congress refused to continue funding telegraph lines, and would sell the line from DC to Baltimore       
   * Private industry would fund telegraph lines  
   * Line were constructed in haste and as cheaply as possible  
   * They often malfunctioned and broke down  
   * Had to then be rebuilt using better material  
   * Initially used to transfer prices of stocks and commodities  
   * Mostly for commercial use  
   * Newspapers would use them to transmit news  
   * In combination with the railroad, the telegraph facillated commerce, and diminished cost  
   * It linked commercial centers  
   * Characterized as the greatest revolution of modern times  
  
## Market Revolution  
   * For it to grow there would need to be changes in merchants and credit  
   * Local merchants took charge of crops near their source  
      > Would trade crops for commodities, and would the crops would be shipped around the world  
   * Credit was a crucial element in the system  
   * Before 1800 most transactions involved barter and no cash  
      > Fine for small local economies  
         Long distance required money  
   * Federal government did not print paper money, it coined gold and silver, but this is too heavy  
   * To meet the demand, private and state banking were created that issued bank notes  
   * A Bank Notes  
      : A piece of paper that promises to redeem the paper in gold or silver coins  
   * Demand for money led to increase in state banks  
      > Most were shady  
         Issuing notes without adequete gold or silver reserve  
   * Direct government aid would also help grow the Market Revolution  
      > Many aspects required government support, needed to be regulated  
         Still only the Republican party  
         Republicans after 1812 decided to no longer have a limitied government and have government support economic development  
         This fractured the Republican party  
    * Leader of pro government group was known as Henry Clay  
    * Elected in congress in 1812  
    * Leader of the War Hawks  
    * Based his politics on federal support of economic development  
      > AKA the American System  
         Called for high protective tariff  
         Called for transportation to be funded  
         A new Bank of the U.S. to regulated the economy and banking system  
         Goal to make the nation economically self sufficent and free of Europe dependence  
    * Congress of 1816 was dominated by Clay and his allies  
    * They did three things  
      > Adopted the high protective tariff  
         * Supported by all sections of the country
