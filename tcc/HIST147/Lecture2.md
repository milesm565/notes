## The US and Napoleonic Wars
   * The French vs Everyone Else war would effect America
   * 1807 the French dominated Europe
   * The British dominated the ocean
   * They created blockades to try to stop each other from trading
   * They did this by attacking ships
      > This would hurt America's commerce as she traded with both the French and the British 
   * The British would attack American ships and impress British subjects
      > Impressment was to force someone into the military
   *  the British did little to ensure that those they impressed were actually British citizens

      > Vioaltion of international law,
      no nation had the right to impress sailors off a war ship
      this outraged America, people demanded war on Britiain
      Jefferson refused war, instead resorted to the Embargo act
## The Embargo Act
   * Banned all exports from the US
   * Ended international trade 
   * In Jeffersons mind this would
      1. Keep U.S. vessels off the sea
      2. Would pressure Britain to moderate their policies
         > Jefferson thought that they relied on U.S. trade
   * The Embargo hurt the economy, and no one liked it  
   * It was routinely violated, and Jeffersons measures to stop it from being violated had failed 
   * Jefferson repealed the Embargo act before his presidency ended, and the problem with U.S. ships still being attacked was the next president's problem now
## James Madison

   * Nationalist, believed in a strong national government
   * Lacked character to get people to follow him

## Macon's Bill No. 2
   * Bill lifted all embargoes
   * If either Britian or French stopped attacking U.S. ships, America would stop trading with the other
   * Napoleon announced France would end its blockade if Britain does too
      > Madison put embargoes on Britain but not France 
         France still continued to seize U.S. ships
         Maddison refused to have been fooled
   * Madison said if Britian did not end its blockade the U.S. would declare war
## U.S. Indian Policy
   * U.S. Indian policy was to convince the natives to sell land to whites to expand white American territory

         destroy native culture, and take as much land as possible
    * White settlers did not always do this legally
    * William Henry Harrison was good at taking land
    * The Natives started resisting
## Tecumseh
   * Chief of tribe, tried binding all tribes east of the Mississipi into a confederacy to resist white advancement together
   * Tenkskwatawa, his brother, had a relgious message
      > To return to their original lifestyle, the natives had to stop copying white customs
         The great spirit intended the landed used in common by all
    * Natives did not see land as something to be bought and sold
    * Harrison launched a preemptive attack before Tecsumeh
      > He took 1000 soldiers and marched to attack his village
         Tecsumseh was not there, and told his brother to avoid a fight as they were not ready yet
         Tenkskwatawa still ordered his men to attack
    * The battle ended in a draw but the Americans held thier ground
