## Depression of the 1890s
    * A quarter of all railroads went under
    * This means the middle class could not pay their mortgages
    * Many people blamed those who could not find work of laziness
    * Coxey's Army
        > A year into the depression, Jacob Coxey organized an industrial army
            to protest the federal government's inaction
            Coxey proposed many programs, he advocated creation of government jobs
            This project could be financed from bonds
            Coxey told his followers to march on WA DC, picked up allies and sympathizers
            Army stirred panic of those who feared the insurrection of the unemployed
            They jailed Coxey when he tried to read a speech on the capital steps
            First time Americans had large scale demand for government to interfere with the economy
    * Cleveland and the depression
        > His actions towards Coxey, and using the US army to breakup the Pullman strike
            made him to feel unsympathetic to labor
            he attempted to deal with the depresison by lowering tariffs, but it did nothing
            He agreed to add silver to money supply but this also did nothing
            He traded federal bonds from gold from a banking syndicate headed by JP Morgan
            It was profitable for the bankers but this action ignited a political divide
            among Democrats
            his policies appeared to serve interests of bankers
            Democrats lost many seats and controll of congress

## Election of 1896
    * Free Silver
        > Voters did not like the democrats, the populists were hoping to win
            as both major parties failed to deal with depression
            Election would be fought on free silver
            they wanted to add an unlimited amount of silver and hoped it would increase money supply
            and cause inflation
            those who favored silver were farmers, miners
            those who favored the gold standard did not like this
            they believe it would lead to uncontrollable inflation and destroy the economy
            they believed the gold standard was a moral issue 
            those who favored gold were bond holders, people with fixed income
    * The Republicans
        * Nominated William McKinley
            > Champion of gold standard in congress
                ran a traditional campaign, did not leave his home town
        * Favored the gold standard
    * The Democrats
        * Northeast Democrats liked gold
        * Southwest Democrats liked silver
        * They were deadlocked until
        * Nominated William Jennings Bryan
            > Gave a speech in which he praised silver and attacked the gold standard
                believed cities and industry had sapped the country of old values from Jefferson and Jackon
                liked farmers and rural America
                campaigned across the country
        * Gold bugs left and would vote for McKinley
    * The Populists
        * Democrats embrace for silver messed the Populists up
        * They stole their big issue
        * Populists feared if they ran their own candidate they would split the silver vote and McKinley would win
        * Nominated Bryan
            > Ignored the nomination, but whats happening is the populists and democrats are merging
    * Key figure was neither candidate it was instead Mark Hanna
    * Mark Hanna
        > McKinley's best friend
            wanted to put him in the white house
            he understood how American politics was changing
            he understood the pendleton civil service act deprived parties of patronage
            the spoils system, he knew what the new fuel was going to be
            it was money
            Hanna goes to business and bankers and convinces them McKinley's election was in their best interests
            raised moeny from them
            getting 3 1/2 million dollars
            sent 1500 speakers to doubtful districts, blanketed the land with campaign literature
    * McKinley won
        > because Bryan could not convince Urban workers that it was in their best interests to vote for him
    * Meaning 
        1. New urban industrial order was the future of America
        2. Election realigned politcs
            > Republicans emerging as the dominant political party
    * What happened to gold/silver debate?
        > Disasapeared because of discovery of gold in other states
            leading to great expansion of money supply
            gentle inflation

## Assault on black civil and political rights
    * When reconstruction ended the redeemers promised to protect black political rights
        > for the most part they did that
            but then they sought to snuff out all black voters
    * Why?
        1. a new generation of blacks
            > born and educated, never been slaves
                determined to gain complete equality
                most assertive than their parents
                angered many whites
        2. many whites resented any sign of black economic success
            > especially poor white farmers
                whites are supposed to be better than blacks
        3. a revival of the idea that the anglo-saxon race of whites was intellectually superior
        4. populist attempt to form alliances between poor white and black farmers led conservative
            southern democrats to play the race card to destroy those coalitions
    * Disenfranchisement
        1. Literacy test
            > to register to vote you have to prove you can read
                law doesn't say you have to prove you can read in english
        2. Property requirement
            > own a certain amount of property to be able to vote
                most southern blacks don't own anything
        3. Pole tax
            > pay a tax to be able to vote
        4. white primary
            > only white men could vote in democratic party primary
    * A lot of these would effect poor whites
        * Understanding Clause
            > Instead of you have to read the document someone could read for you
                and you just have to understand it as a white men
        * Grandfather clause
            > If your grandfather had voted you can vote
                black grandfathers were slaves
    * Results
        1.To virtually extinguish black voting and political participation
        2.this also disenfranchised most poor whites
        3.destruction of southern republican party
            > majority of republican party was black

## Jim Crow Segregation
    * Blacks challenged this
    * Plessy v. Ferguson
        > Plessy would challenge law seperating railroad cars
            Plessy was both African and European
            Plessy looked white but was technically black
            Plessy was middle class and could challenge these laws in court
            He challenged segregation on constitutional grounds
            Court would create doctorine of seperate but equal
            Supreme court ruled in favor of Louisiana's segregation laws
            Declaring it legal as long as seperate but equal accomadations were provided
            But accomadations were never equal
            Made Jim Crow legal and constituon
