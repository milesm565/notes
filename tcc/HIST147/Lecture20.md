## Northern Response  
    * Lincoln's Opinion  
        > His opposition was done behind the scenes in letters  
            Lincoln was willing to accept a constitutional ammendement to guarantee slavery in the south  
            But refused to open new territory to slavery  
            Three reasons why Lincoln opposed the compromise:  
                1. Abandoning the major reason of the Republican party  
                    > The very reason the party existed was to not expand slavery  
                2. Lincoln and most northerners, believe that were strong unionist sympathy in the south that would eventually compell the seceded states to return to the union  
                    > There was, but it was spread and had no political power  
                        Miscalculation on Lincoln's part  
                3. Lincoln and most northerners believed secession was a bluff  
    * Was Compromise Possible?  
        > Probably not  
            Lincoln in a letter to a Southern friend, pointed out the fundamental problem  
            You think slavery is right, and we think is wrong  
              
  
## The Seceded States Form a Government  
    * The Confedaracy  
        > Drafted a constitution  
    * Constitution  
        > Resembled the US constitution but there were significant differences  
            Three Points:  
                1. The Preamble omitted the general welfare clause  
                2. Document explicitly guaranteed slavery in territories and states  
                3. Forbid protective tariffs  
                    > Outlawed congressional money for internal improvements  
                        Made to strengthen states rights  
            Also included some other differences, president was limited to one six year term  
            Cabinet officers could speak on the floor of congress  
            Delegates chose Jefferson Davis as President, and Alexander Stevens as Vice President  
    * Seizure of US property  
        > At the same time, the confederacy seized arsenals, military bases, and other federal property within their borders  
            They had seized all federal property except two military forts  
            One was Fort Sumter  
  
## War Begins  
    * Fort Sumter  
        > Buchanan tried to resupply Fort Sumter, when Lincoln took office, Sumter was still held by US army forces       
            Fort Sumter became a symbol for both sides  
            To the US it symbolized continued US government power in the South  
            US authority was still being upheld in the seceded states  
            For the confederacy it meant the opposite, they lacked complete power, that they could not control them  
            Northerners insisted on holding Sumter, Southerners pushed to capture it  
    * Lincoln's Plan  
        > By april Lincoln knew he had to save Sumter, and lower risk of military confrontation  
            His plan was to send a supply vessel, that only had food and medicial supplies, no military supplies  
            And no reinforcements  
            Then sent a letter to governor to South Carolina, explaining him what he was going to do, he did not send a letter to the President Davis because they did not recognize the Confederacy as a nation  
            In sending the letter, Lincoln put the difficult decision onto Davis  
            Davis had no choice to start a shooting war, he could not let Lincoln resupply Sumter  
            Began firing upon Fort Sumter  
            Bombardment continued for two days, Garrison Commander Anderson surrenedered because he was running out of ammunition  
    * Lincoln's Proclamation and the Middle South   
        > Declared the seven seceded states to be a open rebellion, and asked for 75,000 volunteers to put down the rebellion  
            Began a surge of patriotism throughout most of the northern states  
            But the most important impact was in the South, the four states that had not seceded, that said if Lincoln suppressed the seceded states they would seceded  
            The four states seceded, which was vital to the survival of the Confederacy  
            Doubled the population and brought land and supplies to the confederacy  
            And so the civil war begun           
  
## Balance of Forces  
    * Expectations  
        > As the war began, the expectation was that it would be a short bloodless conflict, thought there would be one big battle that would decide the war  
    * Union Material Advantages  
        > Union had a huge material advantage over the confederacy, higher population, manufactured 9x as much,  
            railroad system was larger and more efficient, controlled the nation's merchant marine and navy  
            Question was would they be able to use this advantage on the battlefield  
    * Strategic Situation  
        * Confederate Advantage  
            > Although the south did not have a material advantage, they had a strategic advantage  
                They just had to defend  
                It did not have to win the war, a tie would be good enough  
        * Anaconda Plan  
            > US was faced with how to conquer the seceded states  
                Winfield Scott put forth to make a plan  
                Strategy was first to blockade the south with the US navy, preventing trade with foreign nations  
                Then with a huge army occupy the Mississipi river, then starve the confederacy  
                Plan reached the public, and the press ridiculed it as the Anaconda plan  
                Lincoln never officially adopted the plan, but followed the basic ideas and adding to it  
  
## Presidential Leadership  
    * In war the President become the commander and chief of the armed forces  
    * Jefferson Davis  
        > Graduated from college, commanded a regiment in the Mexican war  
            In practice, failed to live up to his potential, he was inflexible, prideful, unwilling to delegate authority, overburden, frequently sick, failed to work well with the confederacy, made bad choices for some Generals, failure to weave out incompetent generals, communicated poorly  
    * Lincoln  
        > Never went to college, father was a cotton planter   
            On paper unfit to be commander and chief, ignorant of theory and history of war  
            Proved to be a superb commander and chief, greatest strength was he understood his limitations, self aware   
            He was willing to defer to men that demonstrated greater knowledge or ability  
            Yet willing to impose his authority over them, he understood that mobilizing a effective military force was similar to former a political coalition  
            Lincoln promoted west point officers to high command, but was also willing to point civilians to secure support for the war effort  
            He ruthlessly removed Generals that were deemed incompetent  
            By doing so, Lincoln found a group of Generals that would lead the union to victory  
            Willing to take radical measures to win the war, established martial law, censored opposition newspapers, arrested vocal opponents, issued the Amancipation Proclamation, enlisted black men into the army  
            His greatest strength was the ability to define the meaning and objective of war, and rallied people to the cause  
            Lincoln defined the conflict as a people's conflict, testing whether democratic government was viable  
            White Southerner's could leave the union because they lost a free election, then democracy was not a viable form of government  
            War was being fought to save democracy, which is what Lincoln set as the inital objective of the conflict, save the union  
            Lincoln would try to do everything to keep slavery out of the war, because he needed support of the Northern Democrats  
                  
## The First Battle and McClennan  
    * First Bull Run  
        > Press were demanding immediate advance to Richmond or the Bull run  
            Lincoln gave in and advanced against the confederates  
            In a battle between amateur armies, the defender has the advantage  
            Eventually union forces broke, and retreated  
            Confederates were just as disorganised in victory, unable to pursue  
            3000 men were killed or wounded, victory energized the south, defeat also rallied the union  
            Demonstrated to leadership on both sides this would not be a short war, and would require large armies  
            Following the defeat, Lincoln got rid of the General and brought in McCellan  
    * George McCellan  
        > Small victories mad him a hero  
            Nickname was Young Napoleon, he would build and train army of the Patomic  
            Liked to make bold plans, and striking swiftly  
            But insisted on achieving perfection of his men before moving his army  
            Moved very slowly which frustrated Lincoln  
            Lincoln would keep him in command long after his inability to command because he was a Northern Democrat, symbolized the Limited War, the war that was only about saving the union not slavery   
            Lincoln demanded daily progress reports, McCellan did nothing, continuing to train his army
