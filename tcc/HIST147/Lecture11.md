## Slaves  
    * Three Classes:  
        1. House Slaves  
        2. Artisans  
        3. Field Hands  
    * Field Hands  
        > Any slave will be called to do field labor when needed  
            Slave women were expected to cook for their own families  
            Slave children not put to work until age 6  
            They were given small tasks  
            At 10 they were put in the field  
    * Two Types of Labor   
        1. Task Labor  
            > Slaves assigned a set amount of work per day  
                Then the rest of the day was theirs after the work  
                System gave slaves a insentive to perform their ask  
                Even outside white supervision  
        2. Gang Labor  
            > Most dominant form of labor  
                Slave divided into gangs  
                Gangs were supervised by an overseer/driver  
                They supervised work in the fields  
                Driver was an older slave which had the trust of master   
                Worked under constant supervision with no breaks  
    * Making Slaves Work       
        * Carrot  
            > Rewards for how well slaves worked  
        * Stick  
            > Rules that govern all aspects of a slave's life  
                Supplemented by state laws: prohibited slaves from learning to read or write, public gatherings, having liquor or firearms, hiring themselves out  
                Slave state codes as they are own  
                Slaves who broke the rules were punished:  
                    1. Persuasian Doctorine  
                        > Refused to discipline slaves with physical force  
                            Instead if slaves broke the rules, denied privileges  
                            If slaves persisted, they would be sold  
                            Used by minority of slave owners  
                    2. Physical Punishment  
                        > Public humiliation, confiscating crops and life stock  
                            Bodily harm, whip  
    * Slaves also lived in fear of being sold, being seperated from family  
    * Masters interfered with slaves lives  
        > Assemble slaves in bible readings  
            Forbid slaves to conduct own religious services  
            Slave couples secure a masters permission before getting married  
            Punished those who sought a divorce  
    * Slave culture  
        * Religion  
            > Combination of white christianity with African culture  
                Black style christianity  
                No slavery was writting into bibles, speeches, and song   
                Moses was the most popular bible story  
                Provided a spiritual life that gave hope better times were coming  
        * Family Life  
            > Provided a fragile buffer against the daily abuses   
                Marriage was loving and stable  
                Marriages had no legal standing because these people under law were considered property  
                Married slave forced constant threats of being seperated  
                Master rape complicated slave marriages  
                Family life still flourished  
                  
        * Slave Housing  
            > Poor plantations were very small  
                Prosperous plantations had better units  
        * Women  
            > With their husband being owned by another master  
                Women were expected to nurse children  
                Women were expected to have lots of kids  
                Barren women were made to work harder and sold  
                Male slaves value fell as they got older  
                Women still maintained their value into their elderly years  
                As house servants, cooks, weavers  
## Slave Resistance  
    * Three forms of resistance:  
        1. Passive or indirect resistance  
            > Deliberately work slowly to protest  
                Withhold labor, pretending to be sick  
                Steal food, very common  
            > Sabotage   
                Tools deliberately broken,  
                Animals willfully neglected,  
                Barns set on fire  
            > Large numbers of plantation whites became suddenly ill  
                Dying of disease that did not effect slaves  
                Poisoned by a slave  
            > This resistance went on everyday  
        2. Running Away  
            > Protesting slavery  
                Thousands did this every year  
                Many returned, while others would hide in the mountains or swamps  
                Only a small fraction made it to freedom in the north or mexico  
        3. Rebellion  
            > Small rebellions happened frequently   
            * Gabriel Prosser  
                > Rallied slaves to rebel  
                    Mobilized a large band of slaves to march  
                    A violent storm dispersed his army  
                    Enabled whites to supress uprising  
            * Louisiana      
                > Several hundred slaves rebelled against their owners  
                    Gathered weapons and marched on New Orleans  
                    Government brought in army, militia, and planters, to crush the rebels  
            * Denmark Vesey  
                > Born a slave, bought his freedom  
                    Taught himself to read and write  
                    Rallied slaves to rebel  
                    Seize the cities arsenals, arm black slaves, force passage to Hade  
                    Plan fell apart when a recruit snitched  
                    Many slaves executed including Vesey  
## Nat Turner Revolt  
    * A slave in Virginia  
        > taught himself how to read  
            wife sold away  
            saw a vision from God to rebel against the whites  
    * The Rebllion  
        > Began with only a few followers  
            Went from plantation to plantation killing every white  
            News of rebellion spread, white militia called into the area  
            Suppressed the black rebels  
            Rebels were rounded up and executed  
            Nat Turner hid into swamps, but was found and was executed  
    * Virginia's repsonse to the uprising  
        > Unsettled many in Virginia  
            Legislation was brought up to slowly amancipate the slaves  
            Legislation failed   
            Last time a southern state debated to volenteerily end slavery
