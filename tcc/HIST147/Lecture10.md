   * Most white families could not afford slaves  
   * Effects:  
      1. South failed to develop local marketing and transport  
         > Middle man brought cotton to the market, reaping the profits  
            Porfits from cotton trade was not in the south  
            Made it difficult for white settlers to invest in manufacturing/non agricultural  
            Most capital was reinvested was land and slaves

            South dependent on north and foreign countries for all manufactured goods  
   * Why did the south do nothing about this?  
      1. The elite were profiting from the system  
      2. Slavery was compatible with capitalism
