## Congressional Reconstruction
    * 14th Amendment 
        > Republicans in congress wanted to maintain the constitutionality of the civil rights and overturn the Dredd-Scott decision
            Only way to do this was with an constitutional amendment
            Every person born in the U.S. is a citizen
            No state could deprive any person life liberty and property without due process of law
        
    * Reconstruction Act
        > Congress moved to deal with the defeated 11 states and set the terms by which they could reenter the union with the reconstruction act
            Abolish the existing governments in the 11 states except for tenesse 
            Those 10 states were divided into 5 districts, each district was placed under a command of a army general
            Martial law was imposed, disinfranchised ex confederate leaders
            Established the way the states could be readmit into the union
            They had to have mens suffrage black and white
            Wrote a new constitution including black suffrage
            They had to ratify the 14th amendent, and give all people equal political rights
            Johnson tried to veto it but the republicans overturned the veto so they were getting tired of this
            They were thinking about impeachment, they wanted to protect reconstruction from Johnson
            They imposed the tenure of office act to do this  
    * Tenure of Office Act
        > The President could not remove executive officials who had been appointed by and with the consent of the senate, without senate approval
    * Impeachment
        > Johnson deliberately violated this law when he fired the Secretary of War, Edward Stanton
            Republicans said this was enough to impeach the president
            Crimes were Violating Tenure of Office Act, hindering execution of the Reconstruction Acts
            Denying the Legitamacy of Congress 
            Republicans could not get enough votes to remove Johnson from office, surviving by a single vote 
            Johnson issued a final amnesty act that pardoned all former confederates in 1868, a election year       
            Republicans nominated Grant
    * 15th Amendment
        > Right to vote to all men
            Would allow republicans to build a southern republican party based on black votes
            Several northern states rejected giving black men the right to vote 
            It did not declare universal male suffrage, or guranteed the free men the right to vote
            It stated you could not deny someone the right to vote because of race
            This left states with other options to reject voters

## New Southern Economic System
    * Sharecropping
        > For the first couple years black would work under a contract system, blacks hated this as it resembled slavery
            Blacks wanted to work unsupervised by whites, and their own land
            Two new labor systems were emerging, first is share cropping 
            Planter broke up the plantation into small family farms
            Black family then worked the farm, at the end of the season they shared the crop with the land owner, usually 50 
            Gave blacks independence from supervision
    * Tenant Farming
        > Second system was similar but involved whites
            Many Yoleman whites lost their land, they would become tenant farmers
            a Tenant farm rented their land, and at the end of the season they got to keep all their crop
            They had to pay their rent
    * Debt
        > Systems worked well, but cotton prices fell meaning their was a endless cycle of debt
            

## Southern Republicnas
    * Blacks
        > One of the goals of the Northern Republicans was to build a Southern Republican party
            Made up of three diverse groups but was dominated by blacks
            Although they had voting power they did not hold no more than a small portion of elected offices 
            This made up the myth of Negro rule, as the other two groups were white men
    * Carpetbaggers
        > Settlers from the north came south after the war
            Settled in the south cause of climate and economic oppurtunity
            Made up a small amount of the southern party, but made up a large portion of Republican office holders
            Doing even better in higher office
    * Scalawags
        > Native born southern whites
            Before the war most of them were Whigs 
            Unionists that opposed secession
            They wanted to modernize the souths economy, government aid to internal improvements
    * Fragile Coalition
        > The weakest links was between the Scalawags and Carpetbaggers, because they battled for leadership in the part
            Scalawags did not like Carpetbaggers often voting with blacks
    * Republican governments
        > Despite the division they did achieve some results
            They provided state wide school systems for both races, rebuilt roads and bridges destroyed by the war
            Passed civil rights laws, much of this required money so Repubicans had to raise taxes, this tax burden fell heavy on Yoleman whites
            This discredited the Republicans to many whites, complaints of debts and corruption

## Destroying Reconstruction
    * Redeemers
        > Opposition to Republicans
            Took over the Southern Democratic party, they were conservative Southern whites
            Issues were high taxes, corruption, and centralization of political power
            The real issue was white supremacy, they wanted nothing to do with biracial democracy
            They would attack reconstruction
    * Terrorism
        > They used terrorism against their political opponents and blacks
            Violence was designed to intimidate blacks and prevent them from voting
    * Ku Klux Klan
        > Redeemers formed various organizations, most infamously the Ku Klux Klan
            Made by former Confederate officers
            Klan recruited from all classes of Southern white society
            Whipped teachers of Freedmen's school and burned them down
            Attacked blacks, terrorised and murdered Republican leaders and voters
            Klan was the military arm of the Democratic Party
    * Enforcement Acts
        > Congress reacted, designed to supress the clan
            Made interference with voting rights a federal crime
            Authorized the president to use the army to enforce it
            Grant Admistration cracked down on the Klan
            Sent government detectives to infiltrate the order
            Grant sent companies of calvary to the most violent districts
            Federal martials arrested thousands of Klansman
            Endicted 3000 men

## New Tactics
    * Redeemers were not going to back down
        1. Made a effort to target the remaining Schalawags
            > Accused them of race treason, southern whites abandoned the Republican party
        2. Organized voting to the poles 
        3. Loosely organized using violence
            > Only struck in the weeks leading to an election
