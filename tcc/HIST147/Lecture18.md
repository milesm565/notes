## Sumner-Brooks Affair  
    * Senator Charles Sumner  
        > Republican Abolitionist  
            Gave a speech called the "The Crime Against Kansas"  
    * "The Crime Against Kansas"  
        > Attacked Kansas policy, spoke of the Rape of Kansas  
            Began a long attack on Senator Andrew Butler of South Carolina  
            Butler did not defend himself, but his nephew Brooks did  
    * Congressman Preston S. Brooks' respone  
        > Walked into the senate and beat Sumner with a cane  
    * Result  
        > Act enraged northerners, illustrating brutalizing effect of slavery  
            Sumner became a hero, unable to return to senate for three years  
            White Southerners treated Brooks as a hero  
  
## Election of 1856  
    * Republicans    
        > Nominated John C Freemont  
            Mexican war hero  
            Born in South Carolina he opposed slavery  
            Platform called for a free kansas  
            Banning slavery from the territories  
            Endorsed Government Aid for internal improvements  
    * Democrats  
        > Nominated James Buchanan  
            Endorsed popular soverignty  
            Attacked Republicans as a sectional party, whose victory would lead to disunion  
            Played the race card, arguing a republican victory would unleash mobs of free blacks to compete for jobs with poor whites  
    * Results  
        > Buchanan won  
            Although they lost, if they could win the conservative Southern states they could win the election of 1860  
    * James Buchanan  
        > Seemed to be overly qualified to be president  
            But resume was deceptive  
            Andrew Jackson appointed him as minister of Russia because it was as far as he could send him out of his sight  
            Indecisive, uncertain, weak, easily manipulated by stronger men  
            Because of the parties dependence on the South, his apointees would be all southerners  
            He would take on pro-slavery policies, even if it hurt the democrats in the north  
            Unfit for president  
  
## Dred Scott Case  
    * Shortly before Buchanan was in office a supreme court case would hold implications for slavery  
    * Who was Dread Scott?  
        > Slave owned by army doctor  
            Army doctor was assigned to free states where he took scott with him  
            The owner died after returning with Scott  
            Scott with a help of a lawyer sued for his freedom  
            Arguing that residents in the Illinois and Wisconsin where slavery was illegal made him free  
            Case wound its way through the Missouri state courts  
            Ruled against Scott, so the lawyer appealed which eventually went to the Supreme Court  
            The issue was not Scott's freedom, it was weather Congress or lower legislators had the power to outlaw slavery in the territories  
    * The Supreme Court Ruling  
        > All southern judges voted against Scott, wanted support of a Northern justice, so Buchanan secretly pressured Northern judges to vote with the southerners  
            Had three parts:  
                1. Court ruled Scott was still a slave  
                2. Free or slave, blacks were not US citizens  
                3. Missouri compromise was unconstitutional  
                    > meant congress could not keep slavery out of the territories  
                        undermined popular soverignty since the majority denied power of territorial legislators to exclude slaves  
    * Reaction in the South  
        > Universal praise  
            meant the southern opinion whether slavery was allowed in the territories was the law   
            i.e. you can take slaves to any territory  
    * Reaction in the North  
        > Critisized, work was denouced as the work of the partisan judges  
            many assumed Buchanan pressured the court to rule as they did  
            denounced as immoral, promised to overturn if they won the election of 1860  
            convinced thousands of northerners the south was engaged in a aggressive attempt to extend slavery throughout the entire nation  
  
## Panic of 1857  
    * Further solidify each sides opinion on the slavery question  
    * Causes  
        > Simple cause: employee of a Ohio investment bank of NY, stole the bank's funds  
            Bank had to stop making Specie payments  
            1400 banks closed their doors, while hundreds of investment houses declared bankruptcy  
            Unemployed workers went on the streets of Northern cities shouting "Bread or Blood"  
            Due to infusing of California gold, the panic subsided by the end of 1857  
            Banks were able to resume Specie payments  
            Effects lingered in Northern industrial communities  
    * Buchanan's Reaction  
        > Refused to intervene in the economy, had the democratic principal  
            Lost him support in many northern communities  
    * Republican Proposal's  
        > Said the panic was caused by the democrats, when they lowered tariffs  
            Made a great political argument  
            Put forward what would be their economic plan for the next several decades, inspired by the American system  
            Consisted of a high protected tariff  
            Added a Homestead act, to give free land to farmers  
            Called funding for state colleges  
            Money for internal improvements  
            Would put thousands to work  
            Plan repackaged with the republican's anti-slavery platform would appeal to a growing population  
    * South's Reaction  
        > Saw panic as a vindication of their labor system  
            South was untouched by the panic  
            As cotton prices held steady, and crops set new records  
            Led Senator James Hammon to give a King Cotton speech  
    * "King Cotton"  
        > Argued cotton saved the country from the panic  
            it was conclusive proof of slavery's virtues  
            many white southerners agreed  
            Buchanan would make a great political blunder in the Lecompton Constitution, further dividing the democrats  
  
## Lecompton Constituion  
    * What  
        > Involved kansas - pro slavery leaders of Lecompton Anti-slavery forces refused to participate  
            Decided to write a pro-slavery constitution to make Kansas a slave state  
            Delegates knew it was unpopular, so they sent it to WA to reviewed by Congress  
            Territorial governer knew the constitution was a fraud and told the President to reject Lecompton  
            President refused to listen, and instead of rejecting Lecompton and endorsed it and sent it to congress  
            Asking to admit Kansas as a slave state  
    * Effects  
        > Decision split the Northern democrats including Stephen Douglas  
            It clearly violated popular soverignty, which Douglas based his politics on  
            Douglas challenged Buchanan  
            Met in the white house and ended up in a screaming match  
            Buchanan threatened to destroy Douglas if he didn't back Lecompton  
            Douglas openly joined the Republicans in opposing the Lecompton Constituion  
            Despite Buchanan's support, congress rejected Lecompton  
            Demonstrated political weakness for the president  
            Great personal victory for Douglas, but democratic party was further split  
            Northern democrats voted against Lecompton, led to Southern democrats to question how much long will Northern party members will support the south  
            Southerners were demanding a federal slave code to protect slavery in territories  
    * Kansas After 1858  
        > A year later congress ordered a refferendum on Lecompton on the territory  
            Ensured when Kansas became a state, it would be a free state  
## Rise of Abraham Lincoln  
    * Prominent republicans were saying Illinois republicans to allow Democrats to win and elect Douglas because of his stance on Lecompton  
    * Early life  
        > Unknown outside of Illinois  
            Read widely, he did not want to become a farmer  
            Then he found his calling, politics, was a Whig  
            Hero was Henry Clay  
            In 1846 he was elected into the House of Representatives   
            After that he began practicing law  
    * Kansas-Nebraska Act   
        > Brought Lincoln back into politics, as he was opposed to the further spread of slavery  
            Not an Abolitionist, but saw issue in moral terms, if slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong  
            Unlike the Albolitionists, he did not blame White Southerners  
            Lincoln was considered a moderate in the North, he recognized it as evil  
    * House Divided Speech  
        > Lincoln said a House Divided against itself could not stand  
            Douglas attacked Lincoln for this speech  
  
## Lincoln-Douglas Debates  
    * 1858 Senate Election  
        > Lincoln challenged Douglas to debates  
            Douglas accepted agree to hold seven debates, beginning in the South and working their way North  
    * Debates  
        > Well attended, reported all across the country
