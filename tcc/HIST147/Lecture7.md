## Jackson's Presidency   
   * Change in presidential power  
   * Promise to punish those who attacked him during the campaign   
   * Clean up corruption  
   * Initiated rotation in office/spoils system  
      > Filling government offices with memebers of your own party  
         Removing the current holders of office, replacing them with your appointees  
         At this time the president appointed every government official  
   * Jackson justified this by two arguments  
      1. He was removing crooks and incompetence  
      2. The principle of rotation in office, which allowed more citizens to participate in government  
   * Expert knowledge: any american can do any job  
   * The spoils system dominated american government in the next half century  
      > Became a source of corruption  
   * When a new party took control of the government, they would replace government officials with their appointees from their party, regardless of qualification  
   * Jackson only replaced about 10% of government officials  
  
## The First American Sex Scandal  
   * Who would follow Jackson as the next president?  
   * When Jackson entered office he was not in good health  
   * Most people believed he would serve only one term  
   * Two men hoped to succeed Jackson  
      1. Vice President, John C Calhoon  
      2. Secretary of State, Van Buren  
   * Most of Jacksons cabinet members were not loyal, except for John Eaton  
   * Eaton married Peggy O'Neal  
   * She was married to a U.S. navy officer  
   * She had a reputation of cheating  
   * Most wives took offense at the presence of Peggy  
      > They attacked her socially  
   * Jackson compared the attacks on Peggy to those on his wife Rachael  
   * Jackson refused to believe the rumors of Peggy  
   * Jackson blamed Calhoun and Clay for the affair  
   * It caused a divide between Jackson and Calhoun  
   * Jackson found out Calhoun denounced him about his advance on Florida  
   * Jackson severed communications with Calhoun  
   * Vanburen befriended Peggy, invited the Eatons to his parties  
   * Vanburen won Jackson's support and friendship, and became Jackson's successor  
   * Jackson removed all cabinet members, and appointed a new one loyal to him  
  
## Indian Removal  
   * Jackson firmly stood behind the idea of Indian removal  
   * So far indian policy had been to take indian land through treaties and make them adopt white culture  
   * But now people wanted to remove the Indians from the east and relocate them west   
   * Georgia pushed the Cherokees to move regardless of treaty  
   * Jackson believed it was time to push a federal policy on Indian removal  
      > Force removal west of the Mississpi  
   * In 1830 Jackson asked congress to pass the Indian removal act  
   * Established designated Indian territory, now Oklahoma  
   * They guarenteed each tribe would receive an amount of land in the new territory equal to what they were leaving behind  
   * During their first year, they would be given food, tools, and protection of federal troops  
   * Promised once their, each tribe would function independently from the US  
   * Bill was opposed on moral grounds  
      > Led by sen. of new jersey  
   * Grass Roots Protest Movement  
   * People who joined this movement became Albalitionists  
   * Jackson passed the bill barely  
   * Slave slates voted for it, the free states voted 2:1 against it  
   * Jackson met the Chocktah, signed a treaty for removal  
   * The government secured the treaty by bribing several tribe leaders  
   * A lot of tribes moved, but some tribes resisted  
   * The Cherookes, who had done the most to develop white culture, resisted in the courts  
   * Court led by Marshal ruled the natives were domestic dependent nations  
   * Only the federal government could make treaties with them, not states  
   * Marshal ruled that the Cherokees could not be forced to be removed  
   * Only could be removed with their permission  
   * Ruling required Jackson to protect the Cherookes from the state of Georgia  
   * But Jackson ignored this, he began arranging their removal, but they still resisted  
   * In 1895 the federal government met and the treaty of new echota was signed  
   * They agreed the Cherokee would move west for $4.5 million  
   * The treaty was a fraud, most Cherokees opposed it  
      > They called it the Christmas Trick of New Echota  
   * They protested in WA, but Jackson ignored them, and legitamized the treaty in Congress  
   * Some Cherokees moved west, but still many remained in Georga  
   * Congress refused to revoke the treaty  
   * Several thousand US army troups rounded up the Indians and moved them  
   * They were followed by whites, who looted the Cherokees previous property  
   * Trail of Tears, the moving to the west   
      > 4000 Indians died during it  
   * Some Indians resisted with force  
   * Black Hawk came back to the east  
   * **Black Hawk War**  
   * Seminoles resisted  
   * Second Seminole War  
      > A few Seminoles agreed to removed, but several fled to the swamps  
         The war began when federal troops followed Jackson's orders to remove the Indians by force  
         Many fugitive slaves lived among the Seminoels  
         Seminoles resisted with Gorilla warfare  
         US used a white flag to trick them, US violated the flag of truce  
         US army would capture small groups of Seminoles and ship them west  
         In 1842, the US army declared victory, though 2000 Seminoles still remained in the swamps  
         In 1850, a third Seminole war would occur to evict those still remained, it would be a draw, and they would create a refuge in Florida for Indians  
   * Indians received 32 million acres, but left behind 100 million acres  
   * This land would be used for cotton and slavery  
   * Jacksons and fellow citizens did not see Indiands or enslaved blacks as members of the US  
   * US also established a permenant Indian frontier  
      > Whites considered this land to be worthless  
   * Indian frontier was already being broken by white settlers  
   * White settlers would move directly there in Kansas  
   * Thus the permenant Indian frontier never materialized  
## The Tarrif and John C. Calhoun  
   * The congress of 1816 had a high protective tariff, initially supported by all sections of the country  
   * By the end of the 1820s the south despised the tariff  
   * The south exported cotton and imported manufactured goods, lots came from england  
   * A high tariff increased the prices of everything they bought, hurting the region economically  
   * The tariff was an encroachment on states rights, and a threat to slavery, to settlers  
   * In 1828 congress passed a new tariff, the south called the Tariff of abominations  
   * This tariff was the turning point on John C. Calhoun  
   * John C. Calhoun  
      > Born in South Carolina  
         Educated at Yale as a lawyer  
         Slave owner  
         Elected into congress  
         War Hawk, ally of Henry Clay  
         Shared Clay's national philosphy  
         Supported the American system  
         Wanted the presidency  
         Believed the new tariff would impoverish the south  
         Abandoned his nationalist philosphy, and defended states rights and slavery  
         Wrote the South Carolina Exposition and Protest
