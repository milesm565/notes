## Jim Crow Segregation 
    * Plessy v. Ferguson
        > Seperate but equal
    * Lynch mob
        > Key instrument in creation and maintainence in new racial order
            Usually caused by accusations of blacks raping white men
            served as a means of social control to terrify blacks
    * Wilmington
        > State of successful fusion of government of black republicans and white populist
            elected blacks to municipal offices
            this infuriated the white elite
            fusion government kept control by winning election
            infuriated Waddle and his allies
            2000 white men rampaged through city streets, armed

            to not come back
            new city government stripped black people of jobs and voting rights
            despite appeals to governor and president, they received no help
            marked the first time a lawfully elected government was overthrown

## The Black Response
    * Booker T. Washington
        > During reconstruction he received an education and became a teacher
            Washington argued blacks needed to accept the new racial order
            and adjust to it rather than fight for their political and civil rights
            he argued they needed to educate themselves and prove their economic value
            by doing this they would eventually receive their rights
    * WEB Du Bois
        > opposed Bookers positions
            first black man to get a PHD
            Du Bois demanded immediate political and civil liberty for blacks
            blacks must never stop fighting to get their rights
            founded the NAACP would be the largest civil rights group
    * Chances of either working
        > Neither had any chance
            white elites, middle class had no interest
            in fighting for black rights

    * Expansion continued after the war
    * William Seward
        > led expansion

            first to pursue policy of overseas expansion
            not just territorial but commercial expansion 
            the industrializing US should establish naval bases
            direct a highway to asia in order to gain access to foreign markets
    * Alaska
        > Seward made first post war expansion when he purchased Alaska from Russia
            Seward was convinced Alaska would enhance American power
            others said it was Seward's falling
            Seward convince congress to approve the deal and to annex the tiny uninhabited midway island

                but once they stop they die
        5. Continued prosperity at home required overseas markets
        6. As exports grew American companies and farmers became increasingly intertwined in world economy

        * Published book called the Influence of Sea Power on History    
            > Argued sea power is necessary for national greatness
        * Four proposals
            1. The US needed to build a powerful modern navy
            2. The US needed to acquire territory overseas for bases
            3. needed to build a canal in central US linking pacific and atlantic oceans

    * Reaction in US
        > President Cleveland was appalled and refused to annex the island

            britains refusal to negotiate was evidence of its imperial design
    * US demands
        > submit the dispute to arbitration
            british initially ignored demand
            cleveland's secretary of state wrote a letter to british
            asserting US hegemony over all of latin America
