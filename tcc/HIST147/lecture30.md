## Rise of the Populists            
    * Revolt against America system, that was brewing in Rural farmer America
    * Farmers Problems
        > Populist emerged out of problems farmers faced
            because country was on a gold standard they faced declining prices
            many were falling in to debt
            another problem they faced were the monopolistic practices of railroads
            that charged high rates, many farmers only lived next to a single railraod
            Farmers felt exploited by middlemen that controlled grain elevators and victimized by high credit costs
            and deflation
    * Farmers Alliances
        > Initally farmers did not turn to politics to solve this problem
            they formed alliances they believed in the Labor Theory of Value
            which meant that those who produced goods should receive the full value of their labor
            alliances tried to relieve economic distress by working together to get best price
            formed stores, sold cooperatively, but for many of them it was difficult to raise the capital
            to do these things as banks denied them loans
            also believed the two major parties were ignoring their problems
    * In 1890 the alliances turned to politcs
        * They agreed prices were too low, transportation costs was too high
        * They won victories
            > four govenorships
                control of 11 state legislatures
                sent three senators and 44 congressmen to Washington
                these successes led these groups to form a national political party
                The Peoples Party or the Populists
    * Platform
        * Farmers were joined by miners
        * They emphasized three things
            1. anti monopolism
            2. government action on behalf of farmers and workers
            3. increase popular control of the government
        * Ten points
            1. wanted federal government ownership of Railroads, telegraph, and telephone
            2. free coinage of silver
                > add silver to money supply
            3. graduated income tax
            4. popular election of US senators
            5. advocated for initiative where people can pass legislation directly
            6. sub treasury system, allow farmers to hold crops off the market when prices were low
                > in the next three they wanted to attract industrial workers to party
            7. they denounced use of pinkerten detectives in labor disputes
            8. called for an 8 hour work day
            9. called for immigration restrictions
            10. sought black votes in the south
                > black farmers faced economic problems poor white farmers did
                    called for civil rights for all
    * Conservative movement
        > Goal was to perserve rural farmer America
            saw emergence of Industrial Urban Nation as a threat to this ideal
    * Election of 1892
        > Ran their first Presidential campaign
            chose former union general as President, and former confederate general as Vice 
            they lost
            they made no significant impression among midwest farmers urban workers or the middle class
        
## Depression of 1890s
    * Upset political system
    * Worst depression
    * Causes
        > Began with disaster in farmer economy, wheat prices crashed
            this led people withdrawing money from banks
            this caused bank runs, banks ran out money to withdraw and would have to close their doors
            at the same time a financial panic occurred in London, caused foreign investors to sell American stocks 
            to obtain American funds backed by gold, this drained gold out of the US
            many railroads went bankrupt, then many other companies went bankrupt
