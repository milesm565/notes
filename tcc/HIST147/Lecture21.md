## The First Battle and McCellan  
    * Border States  
        > Divided, and had unionist majority so they did not secede  
            Lincoln arrested pro-secession legislators, securing Mariland, then moving military there  
            Kentucky declared neutrality, both sides respected this and did not move military forces into the state  
            But then the confederacy went into Kentucky, and legislators invited Unionists to come to secure the state  
            By securing these states, the union set themselves up for an easier invasion  
            Secured industry and farmland and soldiers  
## War in the West  
    * Ulysses S. Grant  
        > Lincoln had a general much more aggresive  
            Saw his oppurtunities and opponents problems, learnt from his mistakes  
            Came to realize only complete conquest would subdue the white south  
            Philosophy left little time for perfect arrangements  
            Understood importance of politics in war, always deferred to his political leaders  
            Grant recognized the flaw in the federal defenses, the weakness was in the forts able to attacked by both land and water  
            Grant got permission to attack  
    * Forts Henry and Donelson  
        > Fort Henry fell easily  
            Then went to Donelson  
            Required siege of two weeks  
            Defeated Confederates, only term was immediate surrender  
            Victories made Grant a national hero, destroying Confederate defenses in the west  
            This led to Unionists be able to capture 2/3rds of Tenessee pushing them into Mississipi  
    * Shiloh  
        > Grant was now here, waiting for Union reinforcements before begining a advance into Mississipi  
            Grant felt the rebellion was on the verge of collapse, making little effort to prepare fortified defenses  
            They did not expect a confederate attack, but they did  
            Unionists were able to hold them off until reinforcements arrived  
            20,000 men died, Grant was accused of being incompetent  
            Grant was promoted to desk job with no responsibility  
            Ended Union offensive in the west  
            New Union commander would break up his army to occupy the new territory instead of advancing  
  
## The Penisula Campaign  
    * As Grant and other forces advanced in the west McCellan made a plan  
        > He would go around into the river and attack Richmond quickly  
    * Timid Advance  
        > He advanced slowly, convinced he was outnumbered  
            This would give the confederates enough time to move their army to defend Richmond  
            Negating his entire plan  
    * Robert E. Lee  
        > Confederate general, Scott offered Lee command of the Union army, but he turned it down and joined the confederacy  
            Soldiers did not like him, he was the most aggressive soldier, preferred the bold offensive  
            His army had the highest casualty rate of any in the civil war  
            He lacked a broad view of the war, focused exclusively on Virginia  
            Lee's only thought was to destroy McCellan's army it's know as the Seven Days Battles  
    * Seven Days Battles  
        > Despite his desires Lee was unable to destroy the Union army, the union won most of the battles  
            McCellan treated every victory as a defeat, every time Lee attacked he believed his army was in parell  
            So he retreated, Lee defeated McCellan when the first shot was fired  
            35,000 total men died  
            Destroyed Union moral, gave Confederacy the initiative, prevented McClellan from capturing Richmond  
            If he won it would have probably led to the end of the war, ending before slavery was abolished  
            By prolonging the war, Lee got it to destroy slavery  
              
## Confederate Offensive  
    * Second Bull Run  
        > Lee attacked Pope, a general's, army at bull run  
            Confederate forces destroyed union flank, causing them to retreat back to Washington  
            McClellan did nothing to help Pope, making some to believe he commited treason  
            His victory opened the oppurtunity to invade the north and win the war, specifically Maryland  
    * Lee Invades Maryland  
        * Why  
            > Goal was to win another major victory on Northern soil, he hoped this would convince the US to negotiate a peace, or convince European countries to intervene on the side of the Confederacy  
              
        * Campaign Plans Lost  
            > Divided his army to carry out specific tasks, McClellan moved westward slowly, but a Union soldier found three cigars wrapped in a piece of paper  
                The paper claimed to come from Lee's headquarters, McClennan had Lee's campaign plan, if he moved quickly enough he could destroy his army  
                McClellan moved quicker, but Lee noticed this and thought something was wrong and ordered his army to concentrate in Antietam  
    * Antietam  
        > McClellan attacked Lee, 20,000 men were killed or wounded, Confederate lines were barely held  
            Lee eventually retreated back into Virginia  
            Greatest threat to the union in the war was stopped  
            But McClellan let Lee escape and fight another day, Lincoln was losing patience with McClellan  
            In an attempt to get McClellan to fight Lincoln visited the army and could not convince him to move  
            Lincoln finely fired McClellan  
            The most important thing is that Lincoln signed the Emancipiation Proclamation  
  
## Emancipation  
    * Not an original war goal  
        > Ending slavery  
            When Generals tried to freed slaves of Confederate, Lincoln at first made sure they were not free  
    * Move Toward Emancipation  
        * Role of Black Slaves  
            > Saw the war to be about slavery, and a lot of slaves ran away to Union lines  
                What are we supposed to do with the run aways? Benjamin Butler found a solution  
                Butler claimed slaves were contraband of war, and could be confiscated  
                Lincoln would adopt this, the slaves would be put into camps and put to work for the Union army  
        * Importnace of Slavery to the Confederacy  
            > Slaves by working in the fields freed up white men to serve into the army, slaves were used to build forts and trenches and other stuff for the confederate army  
                Slavery was vital to the confederate war effort, this was obvious, so many people began to say we need to target slavery to win the war  
                Lincoln began to share these thoughts  
    * Lincoln's First Slavery Policy  
        > Aimed at slaves in border slave states, convince these states to free their slaves, the federal government would then pay slave owners compensation for lost property  
            Then would convince the freed slave to immigrate out of the US  
            President claimed if the confederacy was dead in the border slave states, they would think its a doomed institution and it was not worth fighting for  
            Border slave states refused to go along with the plan  
            Lincoln continued to keep pushing this policy, but privately he planned on another strategy   
            The 7 days battles convinced Lincoln he had to strike at slavery in the Confederacy   
    * Lincoln wrote the Emancipation Proclamation  
        > Most Cabinet members agreed with it, but William Seward said you can't issue it after a battlefield defeat, it will seem like a last ditch effort  
            Lincoln put the proclamation away, waiting for a military victory  
            Which is what came with Antietum  
            Few days later he issues the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation  
    * Why officialy adopt emancipation?  
        1. Military Measure to strike at Confederacy depriving it of it's labor force  
        2. To win liberal opinion in Europe, and thus keep Britain and France out of the war  
        3. Provide another war objective for the people of the US  
            > In this case ending slavery would end the war and save the union
