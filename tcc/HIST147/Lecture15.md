## Trails West  
    * Why Go West?  
        > Several reasons:  
            1. Inspired by the idea of Manifest Destiny  
            2. American characteristic of restlessness  
            3. Land hunger  
            4. Depression caused people to sell out and move west  
            5. Avoid the fever infested swamps  
            6. Propaganda, portrayed California and Oregon as Utopias  
    * Oregon and California Trail  
    * Who Went  
        > Young families mostly from towns and farms  
            Not poor  
    * Dangers of the Trails  
        > Long trails, disease, water shortage, famine, exposure,  
            relatively little danger from Indians, upon reaching Oregon they had to immediately find land and build shelter before winter  
    * Donner Party  
        > Dangers illustrated by the Donner Party  
            87 members headed for California  
            Donners decided to try a untested route, but was blocked by a mountain range  
            Took weeks to get through the montains  
            Just about made it before November  
            Had a party, but it snowed the next night  
            By mid december the food was gone  
            10 men and 5 women, tried to walk back through the mountain  
            8 men died, and eaten by the survivers  
            In the main party they would also eat those who died  
            By the time a rescue group came 40 party members had died  
    * The Mormons  
        > Not everyone went west to expand America, some went west to escape the U.S.  
            Christians considered them heretics  
            Mormons voted as a group, Americans saw this as undermining democracy  
            A mob killed Smith and his brother, the new leader decided the Mormons needed to go west  
            Decided to go to the great Salk Lake Basin  
            Went west in a series of companys  
            Each group had its own leader and armed guards  
            The first group led by Young planted crops for those following them  
            Life was hard and dangerous, wagons broke, feed supplies shortages, illness  
            200 died  
            Under Young's leadership majority survived and made it to Utah  
            3000 mormons entered the Salk Lake region  
            Established state based government  
    * Results in 1860  
        > 350,000 Americans went through the trails  
            34,000 died  
            Oregon and California had become states as a result  
      
## Election of 1844  
    * Who replaces Tyler  
    * Van Buren and Henry Clay  
    * Dominated by Expansion  
        > Both did not like Texas annexation  
            Van Buren position upset Andrew Jackson  
            Jackson made sure Van Buren did not get the nomination  
            as Jackson wanted Texas  
            Instead of Van Buren, the democrats nominated James Polk  
    * James Polk and the Democrats  
        > Dark Horse Candidate, no one expected him to be nominated  
            Called for annex Texas, and acquisition of California and all of Oregon  
              
    * Henry Clay and the Whig's  
        > Initially maintained positon of opposition to annexation of Texas  
            as election proceeded, many voters favord annexing Texas  
            Clay commited another political error  
            Clay wrote letters to newspapers, that he might think about annexing Texas  
            Clay lost votes  
            Deciding factor was the Anti-slavery party the Liberty party  
              
## Polk's Presidency  
    * Biography  
        > Not a popular president  
            Cold, formal, humorless  
            One of the most successful president, he achieved every goal he set  
    * Acquisition of Oregon  
        * Negotiations with the British  
            > Privately offered a deal with the British, split Oregon on the 49th parallel, and threw in Vancouver  
                British said no first, but as more people poured into Oregon they reconsidered  
                agreed to to his deal  
                Polk did this because he expects war with Mexico  
        * Northern Democrats and Polk's deal   
            > Polk's deal upset northern democrats  
                felt betrayed Polk did not fight to retain all of Oregon  
                But was willing to go to war for Texas which could be used as slave territory  
                northern democrats feared this  
  
## Causes of the War with Mexico  
    * U.S. annexation of Texas  
        > Before he became President, Tyler annexed Texas  
            Tyler could not get enough people to vote for treaty  
            So he invented a joint resolution  
            Each house would vote on the treaty on a simple majority  
            Avoids necessity of 2/3rds vote  
    * Polk, Texas, and California  
        * Diplmotatic initiative  
            > Mexas cut off diplmoatic relations and did not recognize the annex  
                Polk sided with Texas about Mexico's border  
                Polks sends diplomatic to Mexico with a offer  
                Offers to cancel the Mexican debt owed to the U.S., in return  
                for the recognization of the annex and acceptance of the Real Grande as the border  
                Offered up to 30 million dollars to buy New Mexico and California  
                Mexico refused to receive the diplomat  
                When they heard he was in the country, anti american riots broke out  
                Military coup replaced General with President  
                New President says Mexico will not negotiate  
        * Military Moves  
            > Polk orders Zachary Taylor to march into the Real Grande to enter the disputed zone  
                Polk's goal wants war but wants the Mexicans to fire the first shot  
                Polk receives message from Taylor, Mexico attacked, and Polk has his cause of war  
                Asks congress for decoration of war, claiming American blood has been shed on American soil  
  
## US and the Mexican War  
    * Polk's Strategy  
        > 3 Parts:  
            1. Clear Mexicans from Texas occupy Northern provinces of Mexico  
            2. Conquer California and New Mexico, Polk hoped the Mexicans would want piece and if they did not the third part would be executed  
            3. Invade central Mexico and capture Mexico city  
    * Opposition Movement  
        * Why and Who  
            > Northern Americans disliked Polk's war  
                believed the war would lead to expansion of slavery  
                others felt Polk lied about outbreak of war  
                and that the US was the real aggressor  
        * Whig Opposition  
            > Henry Clay and Daniel Webster  
                Abraham Lincoln  
                Introduced Spot Resolutions in congress  
                Identify exact spot which American blood had been shed  
                Whig party opposed Polk's war  
                But were not willing of voting against money for troop and supplies  
                Anti-war sentiments saw Whigs gain more house seats  
        * Effectiveness  
            > Failed to prevent prosecution of the war  
                Majority of Americans supported the war effort  
                Had one unintended consequence  
                Reawakened the slavery question  
        * Slavery and the territories  
            > Should slavery be allowed into territories acquired into Mexico  
                Mexico banned slavery into 1820s  
                Introducing slavery into free land  
                Southerners expected any territory acquired be opened to slavery  
                Since most land was south of the Missouri Compromise line  
                Northerners objected to this, Northern Democrats who felt betrayed by Polk  
                Believed his policies were pro slavery  
                Felt the South and it's interests now dominated the Democratic party  
                Northern Democrats were compelled to check pro-slavery policies  
                One of these was **Wilmot**  
        * Wilmot Proviso  
            > Forbidded slavery from any territory acquired from Mexico  
                Divided the country North and South  
                Fill was endursed by every northern legislator  
                Passed the house where North had the advantage  
                In the Senate it failed because 5 Northern Democrats joined with the South against it  
                South found it insulting, fearing if it became law, all Western territories would be free slates  
                Giving free states more power than slave states in the National Government  
        * Southern Response  
            * Calhoun's Resolution  
                > Calhoun said the territory should be opened to slavery  
                    This resolution failed  
                    Issued would not be resolved as both sides would not back down  
                    Issue of slavery threatened to tear the county appart
