## Douglas and Lincoln as Portrayed by their Press Allies  
    * Douglas defender of majority rule and popular soverignty  
    * Lincoln as honest A  
  
## Lincoln-Douglas Debates  
    * Douglas was trying to make Lincoln look like an abolitionist  
    * Douglas accused republicans of refusing to abide by the Dredd-Scott decision  
    * and Racial Equality  
    * Lincoln accused Douglas of pro-slavery and defender of the Dredd-Scott decision  
    * Emphasized the moral demension of the slavery debate  
    * Lincoln's problem was he had a contradictory position on slavery  
    * Lincoln emphasized the moral points of slavery, arguing the real question was morality  
    * Key debate was held at Illinois, where Lincoln who spoke first asked a series of questions to Douglas  
    * Lincoln's questions most important dealt with the Dredd-Scott decision  
    * Ask Douglas could the people of the territory exclude slavery before that territory became a state  
    * Douglas said yes they could, even though Dredd-Scott said no they could not  
    * The winner  
        > Impossible to say, Douglas was reelected but Republicans got most of the votes from the states  
    * Significance  
        > Had national consequences  
            The Free-Port doctorine saved Douglas in Illinois  
            But what cost him two years later when he sought the democratic nomination for the presidency  
            Debates made Lincoln a national figure   
            These debates made moderate white southerners uneasy about the future, radicals spoke openly about succession    
            When a Republican was elected president in 1860  
            White Southerners realized they no longer had the strength in congress to oppose northern powers  
      
## John Brown's Raid  
    * Slavery could only be ended with the violence  
    * Planned to seize the federal arsenal  
    * In 1859, Brown attacked Harper's Ferry, Virginia  
        * His plan  
            > Planned to arm the slaves who thought they would flock to their side, then move southward inspiring a slave rebellion  
                Abolitionists supported this and helped fund it  
                Fredrick Douglas refused to participate  
        * The Raid  
            > Executed raid with 19 followers  
                They seized armory with several hostages  
                But then no slaves rushed to join him  
                There were few slaves there to begin with  
                Then he allowed a train who had been stopped continue onto Washington D.C.  
                Word of the raid was spreading accross the region  
                Armed virginians, and US marines stormed the engine house which Brown was hiding at  
                Brown was executed  
    * Northern Reaction  
        > Republicans dissascociated themselves from his actions but endorsed his nobility  
            His couragous death made him a hero  
    * Southern Reaction   
        > Saw him as a symbol of Northern ruthlessness  
            Did not believe a northerner would instigate a slave rebellion, their worst nightmare  
            Identified Brown with Republicans and the whole North  
            Panic seized many parts of the South   
            States repaired their militias, Brown's Raid led the South to unknowingly prepare for the civil war  
            Made White Southerners made them feel more isolated an under siege, even moderate southerners were talking about succession if a Republican winning the presidency in the 1860  
  
## Election of 1860  
    * Only thing that could stop a Republican from winning is a united democrat party  
    * Northern democrats wanted to nominate Douglas, Southern did not  
    * Southerners demanded a federal slave code  
    * Something Northern Democrats could not accept  
    * When Northern Democrats refused, Southern Democrats left splitting the two factions  
    * This helped the Republicans  
    * Republican party  
        * Lincoln was not the leading candidate, but the others were considered too extremist  
            > Feared they could not win the lower north  
        * Why Lincoln  
            > Moderate position on slavery  
                Reputation of honesty made him the perfect candidate          
                Able to appeal to the groups the party needed in order to win  
        * Platform  
            > Keep slavery out of territories, high protective tariff, free land for farmers, internal improvements, condemned Brown's Raid as the greatest of crimes  
                Appealed to broad spectrum of voters  
                They were united  
        * Strategy  
            > Win the North, win the election  
                Did not bother to campaign in the south  
                Ballot boxes in the south did not have Lincolns name  
    * Northern Democrats nominated Douglas, standing behind the Free-Port doctorine and popular soveirgnty  
        > Douglas knew could not win, but feared Southern threats of succession  
            Went South to campaign, appealing to Southerners to rally behind the union  
    * White Southerners pledged to succeed with Lincoln won  
    * The Constitutional Union Party  
        > Closing months of the campaign a forth party emerged  
            Made of the reminants of the Whigs, nominated John Bell  
            Strategy was to deny Lincoln majority of electoral college vote, which would throw election to House of Representatives  
    * Results  
        > Lincoln won  
  
## Secession: The Slaveholders Rebellion  
    * White Southern Response to Lincoln's Election  
        > Fear, loathing  
            Fear the republicans, loathing what the union had become  
            Argued if Republicans limited slavery all whites would be impoverished, legally degraded, racially posioned  
            It was imposible to reconcile differences with the North, so followed through with secession  
    * South Carolina Secedes  
        > Held convention to vote on secession, which they voted unanimously  
            Six more states would follow South Carolina out of the union  
            Others said if force was used against the seceded states, they would secede  
    * Why Secede  
        > Election of a Northern president, entirely by Northern votes, meant polical balance of power was in the Northerners hands  
            For the first 70 years of the republic, the south had dominated   
            Lincoln's election meant the end of this, signalling Northern ideology would dominate the future  
            A Republican president could flood the south with abolitionists to Southern federal positions  
            Lincoln would not have done this, but he would have built a Southern Republican party to destroy slavery from within  
            Fear of the northern economy, with it's rapidly growing manufacturing base threatened south independence  
            Political party that had believed slavery was wrong had come to power  
            Lincoln's election meant slavery was doomed at some point in the future  
              
## How Popular was Secession?  
    * Majority of White Southerners  
        * Did not favor immediate Secession, they fell into two camps  
        * Unionists  
            > Came from the back country, opposed secession no matter, cause they always fought against the planters  
        * Cooperationists  
            > Came from the same area as those who favored immediate secession, most were slave owners  
                Made up of 40% of Southern population  
                Wanted to adopt a wait and see position  
                Let Lincoln take office and see what he does  
                After it was clear that the Republicans would not back down  
                They decided to join with the Secessionists  
    * Where did the majority of the population, including blacks, stand?  
        > Secession had a best a bare majority, at worst a large minority  
            But they had political power  
    * Positon of the Middle South   
        > Did not secede but if force was used, they would secede  
  
## Northern Respone  
    * Buchanan's Position  
        > Said secession is illegal  
            but also said the federal government could not prevent secession  
            blamed republicans   
    * The Crittenden Compromise  
        > John Crittiden, this compromise was never passed but only effort made to prevent secession  
            Proposed constituional ammendement, that would extend Missouri Compromise line to Pacific coast and legalize slavery everywhere south of the line  
            Promised no future ammendment would tamper with slavery where it existed  
            This would not become law because of Lincoln
