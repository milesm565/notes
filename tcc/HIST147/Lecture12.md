## Industrial Revolution  
    * Based on the use of factories  
        > Used to mass produce manufactured goods, for mass consumption  
            Increased productivity, reduced labor costs  
            Heart of this was a new source of power  
        * New source of power  
            > Water power, located next to river  
                Steam power, used the steam engine  
                Earliest factories that use this power was textiles  
        * Textiles  
            > Spun cotton into thread, sold to weavers  
                Cotton sheets, shirts, pants  
                Key industry in the early industrial revolution  
                Meaning that cotton was essential to the revolution  
        * Cotton  
            > Huge demand for cotton  
                Majority of cotton came from India, had cheap labor  
                But American Southern cotton dominated the market, replacing India  
                Slave labor was cheaper than Indian labor  
                Slaves producing cotton was a key to the revolution  
    * Began in Britain in 1770s  
        > Where the steam engine was invented,  
            the first textile factories were built that spun cotton,  
            it was so valuable, machines were declared to be state secrets  
## Industrial Revolution in America                  
    * Arrived in the 1790s  
        > First factory would be built by Samuel Slater  
    * Samuel Slater  
        > Started in England, memorized machine plan before leaving Britian,  
            then created the first textile American factory  
            used young women and children to reduce costs  
            factory system grew slowly in the U.S.           
    * The War of 1812 & the growth of U.S. industry  
        1. America was at war with the main supplier of manufactured goods, Britain  
        2. New England merchants shifted their capital from shipping to manufacturing  
            > Oversea trade was worthless because of the war  
        > The U.S. had to produce for herself  
            factories grew from 7 to 213, most in New England  
    * Why New England?  
        1. New England merchants invested in factories  
        2. New England had an abundance of streams for water power  
        3. New England had an abundance of trees for fuel for steam engines  
        > Center of Industrial Revolution, focused in textile manufacturing  
## Growth of Industry  
    * Francis Cabot Lowell  
        > Was visiting New England factoring  
            saw the Power Loom, that would allow you to spin cotton thread to cotton sheets  
        * Industrial Espionage          
            > Lowell memorized plans for the power loom  
                Once back in the U.S. he replicated it  
                founded hte Boston Manufacturing Company  
        * Boston Manufacturing Company  
            > Had an operational Power Loom  
                produced all steps of cloth production  
                They were so successful they built an entire mill town, called Lowell  
                For labor they hired young women from rural New England/Mill Girls  
        * Mill Grills   
            > Worked long hours,  
                unhealthy conditions,  
                contracted to work a year  
                morally protective enviroment, required to attend church, closely watched  
                Lowell was a success, by 1844 used an 1/8 of the cotton grown in the U.S.  
    * Spread of Industry   
        > In the war of 1812, industry grew, small capitalists would start mills/factories  
            Many owners were master artisans,  
            They eventually went from small businesses to corportations  
    * Factories before the Civil War  
        > Vast majority of factories were modest in size,  
            had few employees  
            while small, still blossomed  
    * Between 1815-1860, the North became an industrial juggernaut  
        > Value of manufactured goods exceeded argiculture    
            There are three main reasons:  
        1. Technology  
            > Tech is the key to the industrial revolution and economy  
                Technological innovation occurred throughout the North  
        2. Abundant natural resources  
            > NA had lots of resources necessary for the revolution  
                Rivers, coal, iron, forests, farmland  
                America did not have to look overseas for their materials  
        3. Inexpensive labor  
            > Allowed NA products to undersell foreign competition  
                A lot of labor was provided by women  
                But in the 1840s, businessmen discovered a cheaper form of labor  
                Immigrants  
## Immigration  
    > Prior to war 1812 most Immigrants were white  
        This changed after 1840  
        Vast majority of immigrants were Roman catholics from Ireland and Germany  
    * Where they came from and where they settled  
        * Political Unrest in Germany  
            > Germany was not an united country  
                Dominated by Prussia  
                Germany had many revolutions to create republics,  
                But crushed by Prussia  
                Many revolutionaries fled to U.S. seeking refuge  
                Pouring into Northern cities, majority westward  
                Bought farms and opened businesses  
                Mainly from the middle class  
    * Potato Famine and the Irish   
        > Irish was not independent, owned by Britian  
            Most Irish were peasents  
            Their primary source of calories was the potato  
            But a disease struck the crops, and a famine happened  
            British landlords refused to provide them with food  
            Wide-spread starvation  
            Many Irish immigrated to not starve to death      
            These people had nothing   
            Could not afford to move westward, so they went east  
            They would work any job for low wages  
            Provided much of the labor of the early Industrial Revolution  
            Irish competed against other immigrant groups for jobs, housing, and status   
            Businesses manipulated this to pay low wages  
    * Public Reaction  
        > Varied, business interests looked favoriably on the influx of foreigners  
            because of low labor costs, on the hand labor born workers, resented the competition  
            that came from the immigrants, all segments of the Anglo-Saxon population were annoyed   
            by the language and lifestyle of the foreigners  
            Most alarmy was the growing presence of Roman Catholism  
            There was a long deep hatred for Catholism  
            German and Irish Catholics were despised  
            They believed Catholics were a threat to democracy, as they would vote the way the pope told them  
            Most attacks came from Protestant Ministers  
    * Reaction of Protestant Ministers  
        > Considered the new immigrants a serious threat  
            Catholic churches were burned, priest assaulted, people driven from homes  
    * Political Parties and Immigration  
        > For the most part they tried to ignore the immigration issue  
            Although the democrats were more pro immgrant than the whigs  
            They both had strong anti-immigrant views, but shunned aside  
            But it could not be ignore  
## Urbanization  
    > Growth of cities  
        began in the 1790s and accelerated  
        as cities grew at a huge rate  
    * More and more Americans began living in cities  
        > Between in 1820 and 1850, population increased by 5 fold  
    * Why  
        1. Immigration          
            > As immigrants, especially Irish, settled in urban areas in the north  
                because there was work, and could not afford to migrate west  
        2. Growth of Industry  
            > Also commerce,  
                attracted people looking for careers  
        3. The Panic of 1837  
            > Pushed many people off their farms and into cities  
        4. The Urban standard of living was preferable to living in Rural America  
            > Wages tend to be better  
                Jobs were easier  
                Theatres, public markets, entertainment  
                More churces  
        5. There was autonomy in Urban life  
            > Personal independence from the patriarichal household  
        > Cities still had problems, like violence, poor air  
            Benefits far outweighed their problems  
    * Nevertheless the U.S. remained primarily a rural/small town agrarian nation in 1860  
        > Most Americans lived in a small town/farm/plantation  
            Tied to agricultural work  
            The great transformation had begun though, and would accelerate in the civil war
