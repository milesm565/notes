## Grant Presidency
    * Summary
        > Grant was elected president in 1868
            Corruption and scandals
    * Gold Standard & Deflation
        > The amount of money in circulation would be based on the amount of gold
            Since gold was rare it led to a shrinkage in money supply
            It led to deflation, which was great to manufacturers because everything was cheaper
            It was bad if you produced raw materials, because the value of your produced goods are falling
    * Scandals         
        * Jay Gould
            > Tried to buy a large supply of gold to control the market aided by Grant's Brother in Law
               Gold prices tumbled, Gould sold with profits, because Grant's brother in law was involved it tarred the Grant Administration 
        * Credit Mobilier
            > Construct company established by one of the railroad owners building the transcontinental railroads
                Charged high prices to increase profits for shareholders, to hold their secrets they bribed a lot of senators
                and a congressman that would become Grant's Vice PResident, because of this it further tarred the Grant Administration
        * Whiskey Ring
            > Federal tax on whiskey, but in the midwest whiskey distillers for years bribed federal tax collectors to collect less tax than the companies owed
                Scandal uncovered by the Grant Administration, Grant's secretary was implicated in this 
                These scandals distracted the nation on reconstruction as they thought they should focus on the corruption not the South

## Economic Depression
    * Depression of 1873
        > First industrial depression, a bank was financing the construction of a transcontinental railroad, the bank had made bad loans and went bankrupt, led to more banks closing their doors, and other businesses
            Caused crop prices to collapse
            
    * Effect of Corruption & Depression on Reconstruction
        > Same is true with depression as construction, it led Northerners to concentrate on economic problems in the North and turn from the south
            To most northerners, the failing economy and depression were more important than what happened in the south
            Crippled northern support for reconstruction, and defending it was a losing poliical issue


## Compromise of 1877
    * Presidential election of 1876
        > Democrats nominated Samuel Tilden
            Made a reputation of battling corruption and promised to do the same in Washington
            Republicans nominated Rutherford Hayes, had a reputation of honesty and republicans were try to distance themselves from Grant's administration
            Tilden seemed to have been winning
            Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina returns were disputed, so Hayes refused to concede the election
            So they challenged the ballets, Tilden needed one of these states to be elected, Hayes needed all three
            Went on for months
    * Deal
        > Republicans and Southern democrats made a deal
            Southern Democrats allowed the three states to go to Hayes making him the President, in return Hayes agree to remove the last federal troops in the South to end Reconstruction
            Republicans also agreed to allow Southern Democrats to take over the Government in Florida, Louisana, and South Carolina
            Southern Democrats promised to protect the rights of black men, this compromise ended reconstruction

## Industry After the Civil War
    > Civil war encouraged greater growth of Industry, and it began to dominate the economy
        In 1860 manufacturing had 2 billion in value in 1900 it would have 13 billion
        After the civil war the US shifted from a primarily agricultural economy to one that was dominated by manufacturing
        Economy focused on building capital goods, good that themselves add to the productive capacity of the industrial economy
        Five reasons why
            1. Technological advances
                > new tech allows for the creation of new products and markets
                    Telephone, assembly line, rubber, plastic
            2. Transportation improvements
                > railroad engines and cars, allowed for rapid movement of goods
                    creation of a continental market, significant as manufacturers did not have to look overseas for material or market
            3. Communication Improvements
                > vast expansion of telegraph network, telephone
            4. deflation
                > drop in prices great for industry
            5. competition
                > drove the other four factors
        Also there were changes in manufacturing three new concepts were adopted
            1. Economies of scale
                > By doing something bigger you can do it cheaper
            2. Division of labor
                > Break up labor with several people
            3. Continuous flow
                > They never stopped making the product
                    Idea became product could make it cheaper by making more of it
        This is seen in the meat packing business, cattle were shipped meat packing plants, cows would be unloaded from cars and loaded onto a assembly line, they would be slaughtered, then a continuous flow of carcusses, each worker performs a single task, which they repeat all day long, this process allowed the Union Stockyards to slaughter 75,000 cattle and 300,000 hogs

## Big Business or the Corporation
    * What is a business
        > Rapid growth in industry led to a new phenomena, the big business
            it is a business that has many locations, it makes many different goods
            it is not run by a single person, there are multiple owners
            to manage it you have the rise of bureacuracy
            because of their size, they represent large amount of wealth and power
    * What is a corporation
        > Business that receives a charter from the state granting it special favors
            Two reasons why a business would incorporate
                1. to raise capital
                    > selling bonds or shares
                2. receive protection of limited liability
                    > protects the owners private assets
                        if it is sued or fails, you do not lose your private assets

## First Big Businesses: Railraods
    > Dominant businesses of the second half of the 19th century
        they pioneered the techniques that would define big business
        began with the need to raise capital
        to do this they incorporated then they either sold stocks or issued bonds
        these could be bought or sold leading to the NY stock exchange
        modern investment banking houses emerged to handle the marketing
        result was a centralization of wealth on wallstreet
        railroads caused the Managerial Revolution, which were new management techniques to run a large scale business
        include things like cost accounting, bureacuracy, levels of managers, written rules
        they imposed standarized time zones and time, railroads pioneered new system of labor relations
        Impersonal beuratically controlled, and collective bargaining, railroad workers were skilled and hard replace
        Railroads pioneered the severe competition
        To defeat competitors they attempted to work as much of their capacity as possible, led to rate wars
        They would try to control competition
