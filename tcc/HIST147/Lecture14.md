    * William Lloyd Garrison  
        > Change from voluntary gradual abolition  
            exposed to evils of slavery  
            published a anti-slavery newspaper, the Liberator  
            organized the anti-slavery society  
            demanded slaves must be freed immediately, and treated as equals  
            compensated amancipation was unexceptible  
            colonization unthinkable  
            burnt a copy of the constitution: **Agreement of Hell**  
            anti-southern attitude  
            achieving equality was the only way to bring justice to blacks  
            his stance was rejected by most of the north and south, made a lot of enemies  
    * Mob violence  
        > Destroyed meetings, dragged Garrison through the city  
        * Elijah Lovejoy  
            > Published anti-slavery newspaper was murdered by a mob  
        * Motivation  
            > racism, feared competition with freed blacks  
                middle class whites felt abolitionism upset social order  
    * Divided Over  
        * Women  
            > Spoke in public, apalled conservative men  
                **Grinke Sisters**, saw slavery as an evil  
                encountered as much abuse as abolitionists as anti-abolitionists  
                Garrison supported women, and got a feminist elected into a leadership in the anti-slavery society  
        * Politics  
            * At first Garrison did not want to deal with politics  
            * Liberty Party  
                > First anti-slavery party  
                    nominated James Birney  
            * James Birney  
                > Slave owner, but freed his slaves after converted to christianity  
                    Ending slavery in D.C.  
                    outlaw inner-state slave trade  
                    prohibited new slave states  
    * By the late 1840s, abolition was a growing movement, but few embraced it  
    * Most northerners had little interest with interfering with slavery in the south  
    * Aboltion movement laid the ground work for North's later effor to block the spread of slavery into the western territories  
      
## African American Abolitionists  
    * African American anti-slavery societies  
        > as white abolitionist movements grew, so did blacks  
            assosciated with Garrison  
            white abolitionists seeked blacks as speakers  
    * Tension with Whites   
        > blacks argued they did not have a fair share of leadership positions  
    * David Walker  
        > First prominent black abolitionist, born free in the north  
            author of Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World  
            justified slave rebellion, which most other abolitionists did not  
            was murdered  
    * Fredrick Douglas  
        * Background  
            > Born a slave, fought back against his master, sent to live with a new baltimore master  
                taught by master's wife to read and write, and learnt a trade in ship building  
                after he earned money he ran away  
                became a member of Garrison's anti-slave society  
        * Beliefs  
            > insisted freedom of blacks required not just amancipation, but full equally  
                not accepted by many whites, believed the constitution could be used as a weapon to destroy slavery  
                if an anti-slavery political party could win the election  
              
## Manifest Destiny  
    * What is it?  
        > Lust for land expansion westward  
            It was American's destiny to expand it's democratic institions across the land  
            Would reawaken, the slavery question  
  
## Texas  
    * Spain & Mexico  
        > Spain begun to settle Texas in the 18th century  
            dominated by a native tried known as the Comanche  
    * Comanche  
        > Conducted trade with tribes  
            sent raids to Mexico to capture slaves, horses, etc  
            Spanish bought the Comanche off with gifts  
            But when Mexico became independent, they could not afford this  
            Mexico wanted to settle in Texas  
    * Anglo-American Immigration  
        > Mexico invited Anglo-Americans to Texas  
            many Americans migrated to Texas bringing over black slaves  
    * Situation by 1830  
        > Flood of Americans worried Mexican officials  
            Americans were not loyal to Mexico  
            Most were protestants but Mexican law required them to be catholics  
            Mexico outlawed slavery in 1829, Americans freed their slaves and forced them to sign life-time work contracts  
            Mexico banned further immigration, but law was evaded  
    * American Revolt  
        > Americans declared independence, wrote a constitution legalizing slavery  
            Mexico's president evaded Texas trying to supress revolt  
            Army was defeated by Texans  
            Mexico's president forced to sign treaty to make Texas independent  
            Most Texans did not want to be independent, they would to be part of the U.S.  
    * The Annexation Question  
        > Jackson wanted to Annex the territory, but didn't do so in fear of war with Mexico  
            and reopen the slavery question  
            Jackson recognized Texas's independence  
            John Tyler did not maintain this policy, and wanted to annex Texas  
            Britain had come to favor Texas independence  
            Southerners feared a British dominated Texas would abolish slavery  
            Tyler made a mistake by making Calhoun secretary of state, as he was one of those southerners  
            Wrote a letter to British defendeding slavery  
            Believed the U.S. was justified annexing Texas to protect slavery  
            Northerners were outraged  
            As a result the senate rejected Tyler's annexation  
## The West Coast  
    * California  
        > Covetted by land hungry Americans for its land and ports  
            like Texas, settled by Spain, to convert natives to Catholism  
            Few Mexicans lived there  
            Far away from Mexico city  
            Small community of American merchants settled  
            Assimilated into Mexican culture  
            A second wave started to arrive in California  
            Very different from the merchants  
            No desire to assimilate  
            Hoped to emulate what happened to Texas, colonize, overwhelm, annex  
    * Oregon  
        > U.S. and Britain jointly occupied  
            First Americans were Louis and Clark, followed by fur trappers  
            American Christian missionaries came to the region  
            Dominant power was the British fur company  
            But in the 1840s Oregon fever swept across the midwest  
            Oregon was portrayed as rich in soil, with tall forests  
            Thousands of Americans would make the journey across the continent
