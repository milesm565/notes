# Causes of War 1812  
   * Primary cause to defend freedom of the seas  
   * Second was to stop Indian attacks on western settlers  
   * Third was territorial expansion  
      > White Americans believed the war would allow it to expand territory  
         Looking to acquire Florida and Canada  
         They failed to conquer Canada before  
         Canada was the only place they could realistically attack the british  
         They believed it would fall easily  
   * The U.S. was unprepared for war,  
      > lacked army and navy  
         Lacked money  
         The Bank of U.S. was shut down and they cant get loans for the war   
   * Congress could not increase taxes and could not instill draft  
      > Government was very decentralized  
   * Relied on state militias, and donations  
   * U.S. attempts to avaid Canada ended in failure on 1812 and 1813  
   * 1814 U.S. was on the defense, British counterattacked  
      > Captured Washington D.C.  
         Burned down public buildings: sacking a city  
         Launch against New Orleans  
   * The British did not want this war, most english did not know they were at war  
   * By 1814, the U.S. wanted to end a war  
   * Discuss peace negotiation  
   * They signed the The Treaty of Ghent  
      > They agreed to how things were before to war  
         So it would be like the war never happened  
   * Important event would occur before they both ratified  
# The Hartford Convention  
   * New England states did not like the war  
   * Federalists were on the decline  
      > They were elitists, the rich would rule  
   * In New England federalists would rise to power  
   * Federalists would be elected in the states of New England  
      Look up succession  
   * They condemmed the war, predicted the British would win  
   * Propose constitutional ammendments giving New England more power in federal government  
   * After the Treaty of Ghent was announced, it discredited the Federalists as they predicted British victory   
# Creek War  
   * War fought alongside war of 1812  
   * The Creeks were one of the powerful tribes in American south  
   * They divided into:  
      1. The lower creeks  
         > Lived like farmers, and whites  
      2. The upper creeks  
         > Largely rejected white culture  
   * Red sticks: militant upper creeks  
      > wanted war with America  
   * in 1813 this broke into civil war among the creeks  
   * Red sticks attacked American settlements  
      > Led by William wedaford  
         captured Fort rims  
   * This led white Americans to mobilize, and placed under command of Andrew Jackson  
      > Called Old Hickory because of his toughness  
         Had allies from natives, such as the lower creek  
   * In 1813 Jacksons forces destroyed most of the Red Sticks forces  
      > Red Sticks fled to Horseshoe bend  
         Jackson followed, and attacked Horshoe Bend in early 1814  
         Wedaford escaped but later surrendered  
         Ended the creek war in American victory  
   * The war ended with the Treaty of Fort Jackson  
      > Jackson won land from both the upper and lower creeks  
         he conquered the South East for the U.S.  
         called Jackson Land  
# Final British Counterattack  
   * Aimed at New Orleans  
   * They wanted to ally with the creeks, but the creeks had been defeated  
   * Pakihan moved slowly, allowing the Americans to prepare  
   * Jackson was place in command New Orleans after victory of creeks  
   * On Jan 8th 1815, Pakihan launched a assault on Jackson prepared defenses  
      > Demonstrated British arrogance  
   * The Battle was a slaughter, the British lost a lot of men, Pakihan died as well  
      > Made Jackson a national hero, and saved New Orleans  
         Convinced America winning the war 1812  
# The Results of the War of 1812  
   * It stimulated American nationalism  
   * Destroyed the military capabilites of natives living east of the Mississipi  
      > Tekcumseh was killed during the fighting  
         at the mercy of the white Americans  
   * The war completed the destruction of the federalists political party  
   * Branded Federalists as disloyal, as the Convention was held at the same time as the Treaty of Ghent  
   * Country now ruled by Republicans  
  
# Economic Development of the Country  
   * America in 1800  
      > U.S. was a developing nation  
         Agriculture provideded the livelihood regardless of race or class  
         Geography constrained peoples livelihoods  
         Access to navigable water being the key  
         Wagon transportation a lot more expensive than sea transport  
         Cheap whiskey flooded the country, lots of alcohol abuse  
         Most white Americans lived on family farms,   
         Land ownership was a key to economic security  
         Only minority of farmers owed rent to a landord  
         Taxes were low  
         Many owed mortgage payments to banks  
         American farm families practiced composite farming: produced partly for own consumption, and partly for sale  
         No farm family expected to satisfy all their wants by purchase  
         What mattered was that their activities allowed their families to survive  
         They grew food for their own consumption, and then they would substitute with something they could market  
         A composite farm family could live in a world of both local barter and international trade because they could sell to shipping merchants  
         Getting good to any but local markets was difficult  
         No highways connecting states  
         Their bad roads allowed a family to haul products only a few miles  
         Most long distance travel and trade was by water  
         Explains why most cities were sea ports  
         Poor transportation also means news travelled slowly  
    * Market revolution  
      * Occurred between 1800 and 1860  
      * Americans began growing crops for sale on a market rather than to consume  
      * They began concentrating more effort on producing for distant markets  
      * NW concentrated on wheat  
      * In New England, sheep raising  
      * Upper south tobacco  
      * Lower south cotton  
      * Families were producing a select number of goods to be sold at market  
         > They lost their self sufficency  
            They needed the markets to sell the goods they no longer produced  
            They are becoming dependent on the markets for survival  
      * This was capitalist, as it was based on private property and market exchanges  
      * Began a creation of a national economy  
         > Benefited merchant and planters and land owners  
      * For the this to occur it would need the transportation and government action designed to facilliate economic growth  
# The Transportation Revolution       
   * As people moved further west they needed a means to get their goods to market  
   * Only to be accomplished if transportation was provided   
   * Efficent transportation increased land values, stimulated trade, and strengthened the economy   
   * Went through several stages of transportation methods being developed  
   * First was simple good effect roads  
      > Roads that were paved, instead of rudded paths  
         Built thousands miles of roads local and national  
         National road linked meriland and illinois  
         Roads were great for settlers, but did not meet the demand for moving bulk goods   
         For example in 1815 to transform a ton of oates from Buffalo to NY costed 12x the value of the oats  
         America had natural highways: rivers   
         There was a problem, rivers only go one way
