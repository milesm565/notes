## Strikes
    * Late 19th century contained violent strikes
    * Homestead Strike
        > Andrew Carnigees steel mills, workers were unionized
            Union had good relations with management
            Management did not want to share power with the union of the factory
            That meant destroying the Union, after Carnigee went on vacation to have plausible deniability
            Company set out to destroy the Union leading the workers to go on strike
            Company brought in Pinkerten Detectives, a private detective agency with the specialty of breaking up strikes
            Workers were waiting for them and a battle broke out
            Six workers and three pinkertens were killed, and Pinkertens surrendered
            Allowed company to appeal to state governor and bring in state militia
            State militia ended the strike by escorting them into the plant
    * The Pullman Strike of 1894
        > Biggest strike, George Pullman built railroad cars
            Had good relations with his workers, his workers lived in the company town
            However workers in this town had to pay 80% more for water and gas canceling out high wages
            Pullman planned on cutting wages but refused to cut expenses in the town
            Pullman's workers found sympathy from Eugene Debs
            Debs declared they would not run any train carrying a Pullman car until Pullman negotiated with its workers
            Debs wanted to avoid a strike which he knew the union would lose
            When Pullman still refused to negotiate, they went on strike
            Workers allowed trains carrying U.S. mail to run but that was it
            Railroad companies went to the president and claimed the strikers were interfering with the U.S. mail
            Government sent in deputies to run the mail trains leading to violence between strikers and deputites
            President called in the U.S. army to put down the strike causing a riot leaving some dead
            Strike was crushed, and the American Railroad Union, and Debs throwm into Prison
            Pullman was also hated by everyone,
    * Effects
        > Led middle and upperclass Americans to fear they were on the verge of class warfare
            Created a negative public image for unions, led people to associate strikers with anarchism
            Strikes demostrated state and federal governments supported business interests over labor
    
## Radical Alternatives
    * Socialism
        * Advocates of state ownership and control of businesses
        * Calls for social welfare programs, health insurance, education
        * Prime leader was Eugene Debs
            > Formed the socialist party
                Ran as party's candidate for president
                33 cities had socialist mayors
        * Decline
            > First world war weakened the party, disagreed about America's participation in the war
                split by desertions of the new communist party
                Government cracked down on the party
    * Workers of the World (IWW)
        * Goal was ultimate destruction of the state and replacement by one big union
        * Roots were in the mining and lumber camps of the west 
            > Unstable conditions and employment created large amounts of workers
                that found neither the AFL or the socialists to be appealing
        * Never achieved any meaningful power
            > Refused to cooperate with other labor groups
                Scorned usual labor agreements, reached out to people with no power
                Migrant workers
        * Branded as anarchists, destroyed during WWI when government jailed most of the leaders for conspiracy

## The Middle Class
    * Two groups:
    * Proprietors
        > Old middle class
            people who owned their own business or land
            growth of big businesses made it more difficult
    * Professionals
        > New middle class
            salary white collared professionals
            big business created large number of managerial positions
            did not possess independence over their working conditions that came with ownership
            compensated decently and reasonably secure in their positions
## Urbanization
    * Powered by growth of industry
        > Factories were invariably located within cities, and worker influx led to city growth
    * Urbanization only increased after the civil war
        > Changed cities significantly
    * Old cities
        > Pre 19 century, compact densely settled communites, 3 miles^2
            rich and poor lived and worked together closely
    * New cities
        > Large, residential neighborhoods, parks, 
            new transportation, electric street car, horse carriage
            cities sprouted horizontally and vertically
            with introduction of skyscraper
            one of the two distinctive features between old city and new cities
    * Skyscrapers
        > Made possible with two new technology
            1. Steel
            2. Elevators
    * Department stores
        > Other defining feature of new city
            showed luxury, material abundance, showed rising of consumption
    * New Cities segregated people by class
        > Rich and middle class moved out of the cities and into the suburbs
            they could do this with new transportation
    * Tenements
        > Working class and poor lived here, early version of apartment building
            a single block could contain 10 of tenements
            provided little ventilation, fire hazard, poorly heated
            two toilets to a floor, unsanitary, diseases
## Leisure Time
    * Rising affluence
        > rising wealth
    * Led to flourish of entertainment
        > Saw creation of first forms of popular entertainment
    * Minstrel Show
        * First distinctive form of entertainment
        * songs, dances, comic routines with faces blackened by burnt cork
        * white men immitating blacks
        * replaced by Vaudeville
    * Vaudeville
        * Emerged when Tony Pastor, a theatre manager, captialized on middle class desires and spending
        * featured polite variety programs
        * catered to all social classes
        * Vaudeville show consisted of series of several unrelated acts
            > Comedians, singers, black faced minstrels, animal acts, dancers
        * Vaudeville had large circuits
            1. small time
                > offered artists lower paying contracts for more frequent performances
            2. medium time
                > moderate wages, two performances each day, in purpose built theatres
            3. big time
                > possible pay of several thousand a week, urban theatres patronized by middle and upper class
                    goal was to reach New York cities Palace threatre
        * Decline
            > killed off by talking movies
                survived silent films because it had talking and singing
                movies were cheaper than Vaudeville
                death of Vaudeville was symbolized by when NY Palace theatre became exclusively a movie theatre
                instrumental in success of film television and radio
