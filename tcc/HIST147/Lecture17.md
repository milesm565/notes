## Fugitive Slave Law  
    * The Law  
        > Was routinely violated  
    * Southern View  
        > Key to the compromise of 1850  
    * Antislavery Northern Opinion  
    * Resistance  
        * Underground Railroad  
            > White Abolitionists and Free Blacks helped slaves escape to the North  
                Helped 1000 slaves escape a year   
                Had a symbolic importance  
                Stood as an explicit challenge to the white south  
                Opposition to the law spread, becoming more difficult to enforce  
                It became a dead law  
  
## Uncle Tom's Cabin   
    * Harriet Beecher Stowe  
        > Daughter of minister  
            Neither an abolitionist or writer  
            Apalled by fugitive slave act  
            Led her to write this novel  
            Immediate success  
    * Success of the Novel  
        > 10,000 copies a week  
    * Impact  
        > Appealed to an audience wider than that reached by Abolitionists  
            Stowe avoided the self righteous tone of abolitionist writing  
            Did not seek to convert readers to believe in racial equality  
            They tried having it banned in the south  
            In the North many began to question the justice of slavery  
            Still did not upset the compromise of 1850  
  
## Kansas-Nebraska Act 1854  
    * Democrats had control of the government  
        > One of the leaders in the senate was Douglas  
    * Stephen Douglas  
        > Married a widow with large plantations  
            Politics rested in territorial expansion and popular soverignty, his solution to the slavery problem  
            Wanted to stop the argument about slavery and claim more land  
            Wanted to build a railroad with new land North of the Missouri Compromise land  
    * Popular Soverignty  
        > Idea that local settlers should determine their own institutions about slavery  
    * Southern Complaints  
        > Because the new territory was North, it would give the North greater power over the soth  
    * Compromise  
        > In order to appease the South Douglas would split the new territory into Kansas and Nebraska, it would repeal the Missouri Compromise Line  
            Made the bill vote an party issue, if anyone did not vote for the bill they would be in big trouble  
            This bill passed through compromise, repealed both Missouri Compromise and Compromise of 1850   
    * Northern Reaction   
        > Northerners were furious  
            Bill created more abolitionists   
## Political Fallout  
    * Results in midterm elections  
        * Democratic Party  
            > Disaster for Northern Democrats, went down from 95 to 21  
                Act split Democratic party, as Northerners abandoned it  
                South came to dominate the party  
                Took a pro slavery stance  
                Still remained a national party  
        * Whig Party  
            > Already in decline, in 1852 Clay and Webster died and no one rose to replace them  
                In the 1852 elections the Whigs did not do well  
                Southern Whigs were increasingly moving into the democratic party  
                In the North party was divided between anti-slavery and those undisturbed to slavery  
                Whigs as a National party dissapeared in 1854, two new parties would be the benefitiaries of the Kansas-Nebraska issue  
  
## Know Nothing Party  
    * Anti-immigration  
        > Their issue was not slavery, it was immigration  
            Tapped into the anti-immigration movement that blamed rising crime on immigrants  
    * Reaction of the Political Establishment  
    * Successes   
        > Gained complete control of 3 states  
            Elected 40 congressmen  
    * Failure  
        > Disliked blacks free or slaved, when it came to slavery they adopted the dominant view of their region  
            Northern were opposed, Southern were for, they were never able to resolve this dispute  
            Just as divided as the other parties  
            Two Other Reasons:  
                1. Party Governed ineffectively  
                    > All it did was immigration, they did not have any policies  
                2. Immigration Declined  
                    > Deprived Know Nothings of big issue  
    * Impact  
        > Whigs died because of the rise to this party  
            After 1856 election, in the North they went into the Republican party, South went to the Democratic Party  
            Helped destroy the second party system  
  
## Republican Party  
    * Only existed in the North  
    * Sprang up in response to Kansas and Nebraska  
        > Big issue was slavery in the territories  
    * Who Joined  
        > Made up of a number of different groups all opposed to Kansas and Nebraska  
            Including: Former Free-Soilers, Anti-Slavery Whigs, Anti-Nebraska Democrats  
            Many Whigs in the North refused to join, including Abraham Lincoln and Seward  
            But most Whigs except for conservatives would join the Republican party including Seward and Lincoln  
            Former Whigs were the dominant group in the party  
            Initially Republican party competed with the Know Nothings, but later they out manuevered them, and gained most of their anti-slavery members  
            Republicans became the benefitiary of the Democrats disaster  
            They were not abolitionists, but were anti-slavery  
            Adopted the Free-Labor ideology  
    * Free-labor Ideology  
        > Portrayed North as a land of opportunity, where a man can start as a laborer then through hardwork he can own his own business and farm and hire others to work for him  
            For this society to continue this land had to be exclusively for white men, if slaves were allowed slave-holders would compete unfairly for free white workers  
            So territories had to be kept open to free white men, keep America a middle-class land of opportunity  
            This ideology appealed to those who were against slavery, and those who hated blacks  
    * Other Issues  
        > Find ways to appeal to voters of different backgrounds to ensure its long-term success  
            It adopted a update version of Clay's American System  
            Party became associated with dynamic innovative capitalism  
## Bleeding Kansas  
    * Kansas became a battleground between pro and anti slavery  
        > Few that settled owned slaves  
            Most had a low opinion of blacks  
            Confusion of property boundaries  
            Legal status of slaveries became the focus  
            Local Abolitionists and Southerners were determined to win Kansas  
    * Pro-Slavery and Anti-SLavery Legislatures          
        > Kansas held elections to hold a territorial legislator  
            Many people crossed the border and voted illegally from the South  
            Pro-Slavery forces won control of the legislature  
            Immediately innacted slave code, restricted office holding to pro slavery men  
            Anti-slavery settlers refused to accept stolen election  
            So they formed their won legislature  
            Began organizing in self-defense with arms  
            By 1856 you had two governments, pro-slavery and anti-slavery  
            Pierce was a Northerner but a Democrat, and denounced the free state government  
            Pierce replaced the Governor with the man who backed the pro-slavery forces  
            Pro-slavery men burned down houses of free state church on Lawrence  
            Attack on Lawrence enraged anti-slavery people including John Brown  
    * John Brown  
        > Failed at business  
            Abolitionist who swore to fight slavery  
            Upon hearing news of Sack of Lawrence he thought it was time to fight back   
            Road into Pottawatomie Creek and captured and beat two pro-slavery men  
            Slaughter at Pottawatomie lead to outbreak of civil war  
    * Outbreak of civil war  
        > Took a new governor to impose a truth on both sides
