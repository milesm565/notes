## War with Spain
    * War
        > McKinley still wanted to avoid war
            sent a list of demands to the Spanish
            they accepted all of them except for Cuba independence
            McKinley asked for a declaration of war
    * The Teller Ammendment
        > Attached to the war declaration
            stating the US would not annex Cuba
            congress was saying it was not a war of aggresion
            but privately they saw the war as an oppurtunity to expand
            as Cuba was not spain's only colonial possession
            they would seek to capture other spanish colonies
    * US military
        > Navy was prepared for war
            fully equipped and well trained
            US army was exact opposite
            soldiers were poorly trained
    * Spain 
        > worst condition, they were a declining power
            weak economy, navy and army did not match
            soldiers lacked morale, leadership assumed they would lose
            they had to fight to keep the nations honor
    * The War 
        * Dewey in Manila
            > Showed McKinley's desire for expansion
                navy blew up spanish wooden ships
                give them a small claim to the phillipines
        * Cuba
            > US tried forcing spanish navy to open
                it was poorly organized, US successfully invaded
                captured the heights around Santiago
                most famous action would be
        * With that the war was over and Spain sued for peace
    * The peace treaty
        1. Cuba was granted independence
        2. US gained Puerto Rico, Guam and the Phillipines from Spain 
        * The Platt Amendment
            > Cuba was independent but it was transparent
                Platt Amendment was attached to the peace treaty
                US declared the right to control Cubas foreign policy,
                intervene in Cuba when it felt necessary,
                establish a naval base in Cuba
                Cuba was technically independent but was controlled by the US
    * Anti-imperialist League
        * Acquisition of overseas empire was opposed
        * Opponents came from all ideological backgrounds
            > Republicans, democrats, social workers, labor leaders
        * Four objections
            1. Argued it volated the countries republican principles
                > the constitution granted the federal government no right to acquire territory overseas
                    or govern colonies
            2. it was immoral and unwise
                > US had just became like imperial european nations that gained territory difficult to defend
            3. did not offer ordinary Americans anything
            4. it would compound the nations already difficult racial problems
                > Opponents did want to add these people to the US
        * Result
            > Opposition failed to attract mass following
                because the leaders came from diverse backgrounds
                and were divided over other issues

## Phillipine War
    * The US and the Phillipines
        > Phillipinos felt they should have a say on what happens to their nation
            for the US the phillipines offered ports for China
            Phillipinos did not want to become a US colony
    * Emilio Aguinaldo
        > Revolted against the Spanish shortly before the US spanish war broke out
            at first they wanted US to help, but they became a colony to the US
            Aguinaldo's army controlled most of the Phillipines and began to organize a government
            Phillipines declared their independence making Aguinaldo president
            US intended on occupying Phillipines and fighting broke out 
    * War
        * Phillipinos were poorly trained and armed and were no match for US troops in conventional open combat
        * Unable to defeat the US, the Phillipinos resorted to Guerilla warfare
        * Key moment came when the US captured Aguinaldo
            > By now Aguinaldo and many other Phillipino elites began to fear the war threatened their position on top of Phillipino society
                now Aguinaldo and other elites supported the US
                this began the end of the war
    * Significance
        > US conquered the islands
            made America an major Asian power
            put US in direct competition with other Asian colonial powers
            especially Japan
            Japanese did not the idea of US occupying the phillipines
## Election of 1900
    * McKinley and Roosevelt
        > US anti-imperialist league failed to do anything but still had a chance in 1900
            Roosevelt was a progressive a reformer, party bosses did not like him as he could not be controlled
            Roosevelt was a loyal Republican
            McKinley ran on his accomplishments
    * Bryan
        > Democrats who were now fully merged with the populists nominated Bryan
            he was anti-imperialist who tried to make this an issue in the campaign
            but dropped it when it became apparent it was not a winning issue
            instead he focused on domestic issues, conceding foreign policy argument to McKinley
    * Results
        > McKinley beat Bryan
