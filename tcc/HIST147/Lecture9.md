## Second Party System  
   * The Democrafts  
      > Jackson and his supporters   
   * The Whigs  
      > The term Whig came from the revolution  
         Initially contained contradictiting views  
         The only thing they could agree on was the hatred  
         Andrew Jackson  
         After the elections, the state's righters like Calhoun left the party  
         The party now consisted of Henry Clay, and the American System  
         Party of the middle class, business men who adopted to the Market Revolution  
## Election of 1836  
   * Jackson chose not to seek a third term  
   * The Whigs, because of contradictions, could not agree on a Presidential candidate  
   * So they ran three candidates  
   * Democrafts nominated Jackson's successor, Vanburen  
      > Vanburen lacked support due to suspicision  
   * Vanburen won  
   * Vanburen took office right as the next depression began  
  
## Panic of 1837  
   * Without the BUS to regulate the economy  
      > Lots of land buying  
         State bank became lending money at a dangerous rate  
   * People borrowed money from the bank by mortgaging their land  
   * Then they bought more land from the government  
   * This caused a **Land Bubble**  
      > Assumed price of land would keep going up  
   * Jackson in 1836 issued to the **Specie Circular**  
      > Required people to buy land with specie  
   * Ended the land buying rush  
      > Prices fell  
   * Buyers could no longer sell their land mortgages, had to abandon to their banks  
   * Banks could not recover their loands  
   * **Foreign Impact**  
      > Americans were borrowing a lot from Europe  
         England was suffering pour harvest  
         Needed money for grain, and demanded American debters  
         to pay off in specie  
         American financial system collapsed  
   * Prices fell, banks closed, small farmers lost their land to the banks  
   * Unemployment lines lengthened  
   * Businesses closed  
   * Left property values at a fraction of their original value  
   * Two years later, second wave of bank failurs  
  
## Van Buren's Presidency  
   * Refused to take government action to fix the depression  
      > Believed the government should stay out of the economy  
   * The Whigs  
      > Argued the depression was caused by democratic policies  
         The way out was the American system  
   * Richard Johnson  
      > Vice President  
         Killed Tecumseh  
         Inherited slave Julia Chin  
         Had relationship with her  
         Had two daughters, who Johnson acknowledged  
         Both daughters would marry white men  
         After Chin died, he began another relationship with a slave  
         She left for another man  
         Hunted her down and sold her  
         Then had a relationship with her sister, also a slave  
         His relationships with women were well known  
         But he still had a political career  
   * Election of 1840, depression still going on  
      > Many people could not understand why the federal government  
         did nothing for the depression  
   * Democrats renominated Van Buren  
   * Whigs saw this as their chance to win the presidency  
      > nominated William Henry Harrison  
   * Harrison offered Clay the Vice Presidency  
      > Clay did not respond  
   * Instead Whigs chose John Tyler as Vice Presidency  
   * Whigs ran **Hard-Cider Log-Cabin Campaign**  
      > Portrayed Harrison as a common man  
         who drank Hard-Cider and lived   
         in a Log-Cabin  
   * Portrayed Van Buren as a stuffy aristocrat  
      > Rich snob  
   * Harrison was not a common man  
      > He came from an elite virginia family  
         was rich, had a college education  
   * Van Buren came from a real working class background  
   * Whigs still won  
      > Retained control of congress  
   * Questions about Harissons' health as he was old  
   * Harrison caught a cold, developed into pneumnia, because he didn't wear a jacket  
   * That meant John Tyler was president  
      > It was not clear if a Vice President actually succeeded a president  
         Some argued a Vice President only temporarily filled the role of office  
         Tyler insisted he was now President  
   * Tyler was a Whig, but only because he hated Jackson         
   * Tyler's philosophy was closer to a democrat than a Whig  
   * Whigs thought they could control Tyler  
   * Tyler thought he could be his own man  
   * Whigs wanted to create a third BUS  
   * Tyler vetoed the BUS, declaring it unconstitutional  
   * Clay negotiated Tyler's secretary to make a bill that Tyler would accept  
   * Although initially supporting it, Tyler vetoed it again  
   * Why did Tyler Oppose his Party  
      1. Democratic philosophy made him suspicious of any bank  
      2. Battle over leadership of Whig Party     
         > If the BUS became law, Clay would get credit, making him leader of party  
            Tyler wanted to be leader  
   * Tyler miscalculated, infuriating the party  
      > His entire cabinent resigned  
   * Whigs kicked him out  
   * Became a presidency without a party  
      > Hated by the Whigs  
         Distrusted by democrats  
   * In 1842 the democrats would retake control of congress  
## Cotton Kingdom  
   * Value of South's prior products fallen  
      > South lagging economically  
   * Demand was growing for cotton  
   * Two forms of Cotton  
      1. Sea-Island  
         > Could not survive frost, could only be grown along atlantic coast  
      2. Green-seed cotton  
         > it could be grown throughout entire south  
            It was very difficult to remove seed from cotton  
            Meaning it was not economically viable  
   * In 1793, **Eli Whitney** was working on a tutor on a Georgia plantation   
      > found out about the Green-seed cotton problem  
         invented the Cotton Gin  
   * **Cotton Gin**  
      > Allowed you to easily, cheaply, and quickly remove seeds from Green-seed cotton  
   * Led to massive growth of cotton production  
   * South produced 3/4ths of cotton supply  
   * The south boomed  
  
## Revival of Slavery  
   * Many people believed slavery was a dying institution  
      1. Follwing the revolution, all northern states abolished slavery  
      2. In the south, many masters volunteerily freed his slaves  
      3. Slavery did not seem economically viable  
         > More efficient ways of growing stable crops  
   * The Cotton Boom changed all of this  
      > Created a demand for labor  
         Demand for slaves  
  
## International Slave Trade  
   * Banned in 1808  
   * Stimulated internal slave trade
